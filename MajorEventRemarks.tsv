187564	1993-03-12	WINTER STORM	AL	4	0	5e+09	0	What most called the worst winter storm in Alabama history struck Friday afternoon and lasted until mid-day Saturday.  Snow began falling over north Alabama Friday afternoon, then spread southward overnight, reaching all the way to the Gulf Coast.  The storm was caused by a strong and massive low pressure system that moved from the western Gulf of Mexico into the Florida panhandle, and up the Eastern Seaboard.  The heaviest snow began after midnight when northerly winds of 40 to 55 mph became common.  Frequent lightning discharges occurred for several hours giving an eerie blue-tinged glow to the atmosphere.  By mid-day Saturday snow had accumulated to 6 to 12 inches over North Alabama and 2 to 4 inches at the Gulf Coast.  A 40-mile-wide band of 12 to 20 inches fell from the Birmingham area northeastward to DeKalb and Cherokee counties, generally following the Appalachian Mountains.  High winds combined with the heavy wet snow, felled numerous trees and knocked down power lines over a wide area.  Numerous roads became impassable, and hundreds of thousands of homes were without power.  It was estimated that 400,000 homes were without electricity, and many remained so for several days.  Compounding the snow and power problems, temperatures fell well into the single digits and teens across much of the state Saturday night.  For example, the temperature at the Birmingham Airport fell to 2 degrees, the coldest March temperature ever recorded.  Only 4-wheel drive vehicles could barely maneuver roads, and some roads in north Alabama remained impassable until the following Tuesday.  The snow and high winds knocked many radio and television stations off the air, and severely hampered emergency personnel responding to fires, stranded motorists, and those in dire need of medical attention.  As if the snow, high winds, and extreme cold were not enough, many large trees fell onto homes and businesses.  Numerous awnings, and roofs collapsed under the weight of the heavy snow.  There were at least 14 deaths associated with the exposure or stress due from the storm.  One person froze to death in their home.  Six people died because of abandoned or disabled vehicles.  Seven more people died outside due to exposure.  One of the seven died while waiting in a bus shelter for a bus.  Most of the damage estimates were at least $50 million.  Some estimates ranged between $80 and $100 million.  The following is a categorical list of the sex and ages of some of those who died.  The age and sex of five of the victims was not available.

188633	1995-08-20	HEAT	AL	0	0	0	4e+08	Hot, dry weather was a problem for Alabama throughout the month.  New record high temperatures were set in a number of cities with Critical Heat Alerts in effect for many days during the month.  Birmingham, for example, hit 100 degrees or higher on seven consecutive days from the 13th to the 19th as well as setting  seven new record high temperatures.  At least one county school system, Marshall County, delayed opening schools for one week because of the heat.  One of the industries hit hardest by the heat was agriculture.  Unfortunately, the effects of a hot period are sometimes not fully known until months later.  The poultry industry was hit hard along with a number of crops including tomatoes, cotton, peanuts, and cattle.  The $400 million crop damage is just an estimate. 
192268	1993-10-26	HIGH WINDS	CA	0	89	3.31e+08	0	Strong winds from 20 to 50 mph, hit many areas of southern California.  A gust of 76 mph was reported at the Rialto Airport, in San Bernardino County.  In many canyon areas winds were estimated at over 60 mph.  Winds at Sandberg, in the Tehachapi Mountains, were from 25 to 30 mph, Blythe, in the southern deserts, 35 to 45 mph, in the coastal and valley areas, 25 mph at March Air Force Base, Van Nuys Airport 25 mph, John Wayne Airport 30 mph, Ontario Airport 35 mph and 47 mph at Chino Airport.  These warm and dry Santa Ana winds caused many arson set fires to spread rapidly through the very dry vegetation.  The fires were in the coastal canyons and foothills from Ventura County in the north, to San Diego County in the south.  There were a total of 13 fires, with about 153,000 acres burned and an estimated 540 structures damaged or destroyed.  The highest loss of structures was 366, at Laguna Canyon in Orange County, where 16,682 acres burned.  In many of the fire areas where there were subdivisions, thousands of people had to be evacuated from homes, businesses, hospitals and schools.  At one point some 9,476 firefighters were fighting the fires, throughout southern California. 
192271	1993-11-01	WILD FIRES	CA	3	150	6.19e+08	0	Brush fires swept through canyons and foothills in coastal and valley areas, from Ventura to San Diego Counties. Strong gusty Santa Ana winds caused many arson set fires to spread very quickly, through the dry vegetation.  About 46,000 acres were burned and some 350 homes damaged or destroyed, in Los Angeles, Riverside, Ventura, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.  The most homes destroyed were in the Malibu and Calabasas areas of Los Angeles County.  Many thousands of people were evacuated.  Two people were found burned in their truck on a remote ranch in the Calabasas area.  The third fire victim is unknown. (M88O) (F67O) (?) 
192465	1995-03-10	FLOOD	CA	0	0	0	3e+08	Record Flood of 24 feet on the Salinas river near Bradley in Monterey County.  Record flood of 30.5 feet on the Salinas River Near Salinas on the 12th at 1400 PST.  Widespread road closures including all access to Monterey.  Widespread flooding of agricultural land and crops.  
194464	1995-08-02	HURRICANE ERIN	FL	3	0	0	1.3e+08	The center of Hurricane Erin came ashore near Vero Beach around 0100 EST and moved northwest across Indian River County into Osceola, Orange and Lake Counties. The minimal category one hurricane caused widespread wind damage mostly in Brevard County. On land there were no deaths or serious injuries in east central Florida directly related to the hurricane, although a St. Lucie County man was crushed to death by stack a of plywood while preparing his home for the storm in Ft. Pierce. The 235-foot gambling ship Club Royale out of Palm Beach capsized and sank about 90 miles east of Cape Canaveral. Eight crew members were rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three crew members including the Captain were lost. Spiral bands around Erin's center spawned strong east and then southeast winds in Brevard County. The greatest damage was along the coast from Cape Canaveral to Sebastian Inlet including the towns of Satellite Beach, Indian Harbor Beach and Melbourne Beach. Dozens of large high rise hotels and condominiums suffered major damage to roofs and some walls. Almost all had major water damage due to wind driven rain. Numerous smaller structures such as grocery stores, restaurants and homes also were severely damaged or destroyed by wind along the beaches. A tug boat sank in Port Canaveral as did a few other small boats in other marinas.  In Brevard County 37 structures were destroyed, 81 sustained major damage with 443 reporting minor damage. Two houses were destroyed by fires that were started by downed power lines. Five airplanes were damaged at Melbourne International Airport. The WSR-88D Doppler Radar in Melbourne measured winds near 90 mph along the coast of Brevard County. Wind gusts of 76 and 70 MPH were recorded at the Melbourne and Vero Beach airports respectively.  Inland, widespread minor structural damage to buildings and damage due to fallen trees extended from central Brevard County to the greater Orlando area.  In Osceola County the roof was blown off a fire station in Kissimmee. About 24 buildings, mostly mobile homes, were severely damaged by falling trees. Many streets were flooded. Numerous fallen trees and large limbs damaged houses and cars in Orlando. 
194931	1995-08-03	HURRICANE ERIN	FL	0	0	2.3e+08	5e+06	Hurricane Erin moved across the Gulf of Mexico on August 2 and 3 and turned toward the Northwest Florida coast early Thursday morning.  The center of the storm moved ashore at 0920 CST along Santa Rosa Island along Highway 399 between the National Seashore Day Use Center and the west end of Navarre Beach.  Erin then moved across the city of Pensacola and moved into Baldwin County Alabama near Interstate 10 and the Perdido River.  As Erin moved through Northwest Florida, trees and power lines were blown down and many homes were damaged.  Preliminary damage estimates were $230 million.  More than 2,000 homes were damaged and the power companies estimated that 63 percent of their customers were without power.  Crops also suffered damage with about half of the cotton and 20 to 25 percent of the Pecan crop damaged.  Erin had a broad eye (around 15 miles) as it moved ashore.  Most of the damage from the storm occurred on the east side of the storm.  At least four tornadoes were reported from the storm.  Most of the tornadoes were short lived.  The center of a hurricane had not moved across the Pensacola area since 1926.  Highest wind speeds measured as Erin moved ashore were at the Pensacola Naval Air Station where a sustained wind of 63 mph with gusts to 101 mph were recorded.  Other wind speeds across Northwest Florida were 80 mph with gusts to 97 mph at Hurlburt Field in Mary Esther.  Whiting Field (Navy) in Milton 50 mph with gusts to 58 mph and around the Pensacola Regional Airport 71 mph with gusts to 90 mph.  Highest storm surge was just east of where the storm moved ashore (west part of Navarre Beach) and was six to seven feet.  Storm surge along Pensacola Beach was three to four feet.  The most rainfall was in the Mary Esther area where about four inches of rain fell in a twenty-four hour period.  Milton had 3.76 inches of rain and Pensacola had 2.19 inches.  Lowest sea level pressure was at Pensacola Naval Air Station where 976 mb was recorded. 
194932	1995-10-03	HURRICANE OPAL	FL	1	0	2.1e+09	5e+06	Hurricane Opal moved across the Gulf of Mexico on October 3 and 4.  The spiral bands started affecting the Northwest Florida area Tuesday and continued until the storm moved ashore Wednesday afternoon.  The center of the storm moved ashore at almost the same location as Hurricane Erin did about two months before.  The center of Opal (about five miles in diameter) was much smaller than Erin and was not as easily identifiable.  Opal intensified to a category 4 hurricane early Wednesday morning and diminished to a category 3 at the time of landfall.  Opal moved ashore near Navarre Beach at around 1600 CST.  Opal moved rapidly through Northwest Florida during the afternoon and evening hours on Wednesday and moved into southwest Alabama near the Escambia-Covington County line.  Most of the damage from Opal in Northwest Florida was from the devastating storm surge.  In many places from Navarre Beach to Destin, some of the protecting dunes were washed away.  Opal destroyed most of the homes that were facing the gulf from Navarre Beach to east of Destin.   Preliminary  damage estimates were $2.1 billion dollars.  Almost 300 homes were destroyed with another 1,000 homes suffering major damage.  Crop damage was estimated at $5 million dollars, mostly in northern Santa Rosa and northern Okaloosa Counties.  It was estimated that $50 million in damage was done to recreational boats.  Almost 1,000 boats were damaged.  In addition about 70 boats had been lost or sunknownen.  Several tornadoes were reported with an elderly female dying in an F2 tornado near Crestview (see below  on the 4th at 1130 CST).   As Opal moved north, most of the damage was around and east of the center of the storm.  Estimated sustained wind speeds were 115 mph as Opal moved ashore with the highest observed wind speeds at 83 mph gusting to 144 mph at Hurlburt Field in Mary Esther.  Other wind speeds across Northwest Florida were 62 mph with gusts to 71 mph at Pensacola airport, 59 mph with gusts to 77 mph at Pensacola Naval Air Station and 80 mph with gusts to 115 mph at Eglin AFB in Valparaiso.  Highest storm surges were 10 to 15 feet from Navarre Beach to east of Destin with eight to 12 feet on Santa Rosa Island from Fort Pickens to east of Pensacola Beach.  The surge destroyed highway 399 that runs from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.  U.S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin was also destroyed.   Storm surges of six to eight feet were also observed in the inland bays from Pensacola to Choctawhatchee Bay.  The most rainfall in Opal occurred at Ellyson Field where 15.45 inches fell on October 3 and 4.  Lowest sea level pressure was 955 mb at Pensacola Naval Air Station. 
194933	1993-03-12	TORNADOES, TSTM WIND, HAIL	FL	25	0	1.6e+09	2500000	Tornadoes, Thunderstorm Winds, Hail, Storm Surge, Flooding, Beach Erosion, Snow The "Storm Of The Century" roared across Florida producing a variety of severe and unusual weather conditions for a period of about 18 hours from late Friday the 12th through late afternoon Saturday the 13th.  A severe squall line raced eastward at 50 mph ahead of an intense low producing several tornadoes and strong downbursts as it moved through the state and directly caused seven fatalities.  This was followed by a hitherto unknown  (for the Gulf Coast) winter storm surge of 9 to 12 feet onto the gulf coast in Taylor County, with storm surges and/or tidal and wind driven flooding of 5 to 9 feet elsewhere along the gulf coast of the state and into the lower Keys.  This was followed by a period of 8 to 12 hours of high sustained winds of up to 50 mph with gusts to 70 mph, keeping tides much above normal along the west coast and causing severe beach erosion in many areas.  Total number of fatalities from the storm was 47, including 14 from storm surge and flooding, seven from tornadoes and/or strong downbursts, and four from high winds in the aftermath of the squall line.  Eleven people drowned offshore in the Gulf of Mexico after strong winds swamped or capsized ships  (including seven crewmen from a 200-foot Honduran freighter).  Eleven others died during rescue operations and cleanup activities.  Meanwhile, colder air poured in behind the intense low with up to four inches of snow falling in the panhandle from north of Pensacola to Crestview, and a trace to 3 inches elsewhere across north Florida.  Record or near record low temperatures occurred over much of the state the following two nights.  Total property damage was estimated at $1.6 billion. 
194939	1995-10-04	HURRICANE OPAL	FL	0	0	1e+09	0	Opal, the strongest Hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in 20 years, made landfall near Fort Walton Beach during the early evening. By far the greatest amount of damage occurred due to storm surge along the beaches of Walton, Bay, and Gulf Counties with a decreasing degree of storm surge damage in Franklin, Wakulla, Taylor and Dixie Counties. Inland areas from the Apalachicola river west received varying degrees of wind damage with the most significant damage in Walton, Bay, Washington and Holmes. High water marks, storm surge plus waves, were measured over 25 feet high along parts of the Walton county coast. In Panama City, the storm tide was measured by gage to a level of 6.92 feet while a gage in Apalachicola rose to 6.40 feet. In Walton County, hardest hit areas were Santa Rosa Beach and Sandestin where a reported 50 percent of homes were damaged or destroyed.  Panama City Beach, in Bay County, reported about 25 percent of homes and businesses were a total loss. In easternmost Bay County, Mexico Beach suffered severe storm surge damage with a high percentage of beachfront buildings destroyed. Further  east, Gulf County saw its worst damage along the St Joseph Peninsula and Cape San Blas where a large percentage of homes were damaged or destroyed. Franklin County escaped major damage with several businesses receiving minor flooding in Apalachicola.  Out on St George island, Bruce State Park received serious damage to its beachfront access road and its buildings-causing the park to be closed for an extended period. Wakulla County endured flooding of several homes and businesses.  Damage along the coastlines of Taylor and Dixie counties was confined to mainly minor flooding of low lying buildings along the waterfronts as well as some road damage. No confirmed deaths or injuries were directly attributable to the storm.  One man was fatally injured in DeFuniak Springs when a tree fell on him as he was clearing debris from his yard. (Damage figure estimated.) 
198375	1993-08-31	RIVER FLOOD	IL	0	0	5e+09	5e+09	and Southwest  Illinois,The Great Flood of '93 continued into its second month as the Mississippi, Illinois, and Kaskaskia Rivers reached their peaks early in the month and then began a very slow fall.  Most points along the rivers were still above flood stage at the end of August.  The information in this entry should be treated as a continuation of the July entry.                      Flood Stage  Record  Date  Old Record  Date  Grafton, Illinois:      18       38.15   8/1    33.12    4/28/73 Alton, Illinois:         21       42.71   8/1    36.6     4/29/73 Chester, Illinois:      27       49.69   8/7    43.3     4/30/73  Life along the rivers slowly moved a bit toward normal during August, but for most, normal life along the rivers will never return.  As the water receded at the end of August, the damage became plainly visible.  Destroyed homes and businesses, were the rule, not the exception.  While there was some talk of rebuilding, a growing number of people were seriously considering giving the floodplains back to the rivers and moving to higher ground.  The National Weather Service (NWS) would like to compliment Mr.  Robert Lindemann and Mr.  Charles Staley, two employees on loan to the NWS from the Federal Aviation Administration, who gathered much of the information in this report. Adams County,On Wednesday (August 4) a ferry shuttle was set up on the Mississippi River between Quincy and La Grange since the bridges between Missouri and Illinois were still closed.  Two pontoon boats, carrying more than 40 people each, connected with shuttle busses waiting at the designated landing points. On August 31, the Mississippi River was still 2 feet above flood stage at Quincy.  Calhoun County,On Monday (August 2) officials of Calhoun County reported there were 880 people displaced, up from the 584 counted July 22.  The flood had hit 220 homes and 60 businesses.  At Hardin Sunday (August 1) a levee protecting the town water plant gave way, closing the water plant until the levee was repaired and the floodwater was pumped out.  As of Tuesday (August 10) the boil order remained in effect in Hardin.  On Friday (August 27) the Hardin airlift, a month long effort by National Guard helicopter crews, unloaded their last load.  Reopened Illinois Highway 100 through Kampsville south to Hardin allowed daily food and supplies to be delivered by truck.  The Hardin bridge over the Illinois River remained closed as 7 feet of water was still in East Hardin.  At Kampsville, a sandbag levee protecting the American Archaeological Center broke Tuesday morning (August 3).  Two buildings in the complex, two homes and a business were quickly flooded, however the eleven million prehistoric artifacts were spared.  To date, 13 of the 17 buildings the Center owns had been flooded.  Wednesday (August 4) about 30 homes were flooded and every business was closed in Kampsville due to the Tuesday levee break.  Tuesday (August 10) the boil orders remained in effect in Kampsville. Jersey County,On Sunday (August 1) the mayor of Grafton said his town's water plant was pumping river water spiked with a heavy dose of chlorine.  Residents were warned to use the water only for bathing and flushing toilets.  Floodwater was still rising at Grafton at that time.  The boil order for Jersey County Rural Water District was canceled Friday (August 20).  Thursday ((August 19) a Grafton Alderman said too many of the town's 109 homes are still under water to begin any buy out applications.  Madison County,The Mississippi swamped the landfill on Chouteau Island near Granite City Monday (August 2).  On Sunday (August 1) the water plant at Alton and 12 businesses were flooded when water pushed beneath a buckled street and into low-lying parts of downtown.  Water service was cut off to 72,000 customers.  The levee protecting the older portion of downtown failed in the 200 block of Piasa Street.  By Sunday night the river had taken buildings 3 blocks up from the river and was still climbing.  By Monday (August 2) Alton city officials estimate that Sunday's downtown flooding of a 3 square block area would cost about $4 million just to repair the streets, sidewalks and sewers.  Seventy-five businesses were flooded.  The Alton water plant resumed operation Friday (August 6) but the quality of the water was only suitable for flushing toilets.  As of Sunday (August 8) about 2.3 million gallons of water had been brought in by truck and distributed since the city's water plant was flooded on July 27.  The Illinois-American Water Company in Alton reported Saturday afternoon (August 14) that they had restored water service to all customers in Alton, Godfrey, Brighton, Elsah and Fosterburg.  A company spokesperson said the water was still not safe to drink even if boiled.  By Friday (August 20) a boil water order was lifted for residents of Alton, Brighton, Godfrey, Bunker Hill, Cottage Hills and the Forest Homes - Maple Park water district.  Some distant reaches of the water network were still affected by the boil order as more time was needed to flush out the system.  The mayor's office at Alton advised on Saturday (August 28) that the flood had damaged 45 businesses and 3 vacant buildings.  Monroe County ,On Sunday (August 1) the Columbia levee broke flooding farms and 15,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Bottoms area.  Some 65 homeowners in the Columbia Bottoms area fled Saturday night prior to the break.  Another levee break late Sunday, the second to fail in less than a day displaced about 1,800 people.  Sunday (August 8) officials estimated that 70,000 acres have been flooded in Monroe County, including 900 homes.  Monroe County officials advised on Wednesday (August 18) that the Federal levee along the Mississippi River will be rebuilt to the pre-flood level of 38 feet.  The Army Corps of Engineers call this a 10 year flood level.  The county would like the levee raised to a 100 year flood level and the Corps had agreed to make a study of its economic viability by 1995.  The Columbia mayor said Thursday (7-26) that 65 homes in the Bottoms area outside of the city limits were flooded.  Residents of about 20 of those homes have been able to return.  At Valmeyer, the Fountain Creek levee standing between the floodwater and the town, had water lapping at the top of the levee on Sunday (8/1/92).  The south levee at the creek had been raised to 51 feet by rock and sandbags.  The levee broke north of Valmeyer Monday (August 2) and began drowning the hopes of nearly all the 900 residents, confounding weeks of work and prayer.  The  Valmeyer School District planned to set up school in two portable buildings on the Monroe County Fairgrounds 4 miles east of Valmeyer.  More than 400 students in the district of 550 students have been displaced by the flood.  On August 26, the Mayor of Valmeyer said floodwater damaged 346 of the 350 homes in town and 8 of the 12 businesses.  Around 60% of the property owners had flood insurance.  Despite the flood insurance, many people talked of not returning, or of possibly moving the town to higher ground east of its present location.  Pike County,It was reported on Thursday (August 5) that the U.S.  54 bridge approach on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River may be repaired by early next week, making the bridge useable.  Pedestrians  were allowed to cross the bridge.  In Louisiana, Missouri at 6 P.M.  Saturday (August 7) the U.S.  54 bridge to Pike County Illinois was reopened.  Illinois had closed the bridge July 1, 1993.  Thousands of acres of farmland remained under water due to the Sny Levee break in July, even though some water was returning to the main channel of the Mississippi.  Randolph County,As a wall of water from the levee break near Columbia, IL approached Prairie du Rocher August 1, it caused a flurry of activity in an attempt to save the town.  On Wednesday (August 4) dump trucks poured rocks on top of the levee at Prairie du Rocher.  Workers raised the levee at Prairie du Rocher to 52 feet.  The Army Corps of Engineers blasted holes in a levee southwest of town hoping to divert floodwater back into the Mississippi River.  On Thursday (August 5) the gamble to intentionally flood the bottom land northwest of Prairie du Rocher by blowing the Mississippi River levee paid off.  Although blowing the levee flooded 75 homes north of the levee at Prairie du Rocher these homes would have been flooded anyway with the approaching water from the Columbia levee break.  The Mississippi River crested August 5, with the levee protecting most of the town of Prairie du Rocher holding.  In Chester, on Monday (August 2) guards at the Menard Correctional Center moved 200 prisoners from low-level cells to higher ground.  In Evansville Friday (August 6) the Kaskaskia River caused flooding as it was backed up by the Mississippi River.  The city had been under a boil water order for about a month even though the water treatment plant was sandbagged and the water tests were satisfactory.  The backwater had flooded 6 businesses and 17 homes.  On Thursday (August 26) the Randolph County Sheriff said only 5 of the 162 houses on Kaskaskia Island remained standing.  The island had been flooded when the levee protecting the island blew in July.  The small town of Rockwood, in the southwest corner of Randolph County, reported that as of Saturday (August 28) all 30 homes had been flooded.  St. Clair County,The flood wall protecting East St. Louis held throughout the threat of flooding.  The only other potential problem was in the East Carondelet area where sandbagging stopped any major flooding.  The other problem in East Carondelet was involved the flooding at a propane tank farm across the river in Missouri.  If the tanks had exploded, the community would have been seriously affected.  The EMA officials said on August 31 that there had been no flooding serious in St.  Clair County. 
198690	1995-07-12	HEAT	IL	583	0	0	0	An intense heat wave affected northern Illinois from Wednesday July 12 through Sunday July 16. The heat wave tied or broke several temperature records at Rockford and Chicago. But what set this heat wave apart from others was the extremely high humidities. Dew point temperatures peaked in the lower 80s late Wednesday the 12th and Thursday the 13th and were generally in the middle and upper 70s through the rest of the hot spell. The combined and cumulative effects of several days of high temperatures, high humidity, intense July sunshine (100% possible sunshine recorded at O'Hare Airport in Chicago July 13) and light winds took their toll. 583 people died as a result of the heat in Chicago and surrounding areas. Official temperatures at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport were 7/12; minimum 73 maximum 97 (tied record), 7/13 minimum 81 (record) maximum 104 (record), 7/14 minimum 83 (record), maximum 100 (tied record), 7/15 minimum 75, maximum 98, 7/16 minimum 74, maximum 93. The heat peaked on Thursday July 13. O'Hare had a high of 104 and a low of 81 for an average of 93, 20 degrees above normal. (The all-time record high for Chicago is 105.) The heat index peaked at 119 at 1300 and 1700. At Midway Airport the temperature hit 106. (Midway is not the official Chicago reporting station so the 106 did not become Chicago's official highest temperature.) The heat index at Midway reached 125 at 1400 when the temperature was 103 and the dew point was 79. What was really remarkable was that Meigs Field which sits on a small peninsula over the cool waters of Lake Michigan off the Chicago lakefront reached 103 degrees with a heat index of 115. Rockford had high temperatures of 97, 98, 97 and 94 on the 12 through 15th, respectively. The minimum of 75 on the 14th was a record. The heat index peaked at 125 at 1800 pm on the 13th when the temperature was 98 with a dew point of 83! Commonwealth Edison, which provides much of northern Illinois and virtually all of the Chicago metropolitan area with power, had record demands for electricity on the 12th through the 14th. Power output was 18,234, 19,151 and 19,201 megawatts, respectively. Transformers blew in the southwest suburbs near Joliet causing rolling power outages on the 13th and 14th. The north side of Chicago also lost power as did the northwest suburb of Cary. Draw bridges over the Chicago River had to be hosed down so they would operate and close properly. Several roads buckled from the heat. As many as 500 fire hydrants were opened in Chicago causing loss of water pressure. The city of Chicago used a record 1.8 billion gallons of water on the 13th. The city's water system has a capacity to pump 2 billion gallons a day.  There were over 580 fatalities attributed to the heat. Most of them occurred in the city of Chicago. Most of the deaths occurred two to three days following the peak of the heat wave. Many were elderly people living alone in homes or apartments with no air conditioning. Some had nailed windows shut and were afraid to go out because of crime in their neighborhoods. Emergency officials found people in homes with room temperatures of 120 degrees or higher. Here is a break down of fatalities by county; Lake County, 1 (Ingleside), Grundy County, 1 (Morris), Kane County, 7 (all in Aurora), Winnebago County, 5 (all in Rockford), Will County, 1 (Joliet), Cook, 568. The information from Cook County was provided by the Cook County Medical Examiners Office. 64 of the deaths occurred in suburban Cook County. 504 occurred in Chicago. The dates of the deaths are not known in all cases. Many of the examinations occurred in the days following the heat wave, more occurred later as funeral home and hospital records were checked. Heat was the primary cause of death in 75 of the cases and a secondary cause in the rest of the deaths. Information on morbidity is being compiled by the Cook County Department of Health. An estimate on number of injuries will be available later this year as an addition.

201230	1995-08-01	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	0	5e+08	August precipitation was confined to widely scattered thunderstorm activity, which produced a wide variation of monthly rainfall amounts.  The highest of these was 9.23 inches at Bondurant in central Iowa (details on that below) to .29 inches at Dubuque for the 4th driest August on record at Dubuque.  Statewide rainfall distribution was highest over northwest and north central Iowa, and lowest over the south central counties.  The dry weather conditions combined with well above normal temperatures translated to the warmest month recorded in Iowa since July 1988 and the 4th warmest August of record.  For the summer as a whole, June through August of 1995 ranked 14th warmest in the 123 years of record.  The dry conditions resulted in deterioration of Iowas corn and soybean crops.  Yield losses were greatest over southern Iowa where plantings were delayed by excessive spring rainfall.  Reports indicate losses in the corn of between five and 25 bushels per acre with the greatest over the south.  Soybean loses were not that great and were generally 5% or less.  In dollars this translates to about $420 million in corn and $116 million in soybeans. 
201236	1995-06-01	EXCESSIVE WETNESS	IA	0	0	0	1.42e+08	Much of Iowa,The wet conditions that were so persistent throughout the month of May continued into the first part of June.  The wet conditions resulted in further planting delays and the switching of part of the corn crop into soy beans.  Southern Iowa was hardest hit with under one percent of the crop in the ground during by the second week of June.  Planting progress accelerated after the 10th of the month with virtually all of the crop, both corn and soybeans, was in the ground by the 20th of the month.  Generally speaking, yields fall about a bushel per acre for corn planted after the 20th of May.  Yields begin to drop for soybeans after the 10th of June.  In total, additional losses during June were around $140 million. 
201222	1995-09-21	FREEZE	IA	0	0	0	2e+08	A strong cold front pushed south across Iowa bringing with it one of the earliest freezes on record.  Coupled with the fact that crop maturation was behind schedule, significant freeze damage occurred.  Temperatures dipped to as low as 24° F. (-5° C.) over the northwest counties and to the freezing point over the southeast.  These temperatures were combined with a five to 10 knot wind and lasted for up to eight hours in the northwest and about three hours over the southeast.  The soybeans were hardest hit with approximately $30 million bushels lost.  The corn crop was not as badly damaged as drought from the previous month had already done significant damage to the crop.  In dollar amounts, damage to the soybeans was around $195 million, while the corn suffered about a $9 million loss. 
207124	1995-05-08	HEAVY RAIN/SEVERE WEATHER	LA	0	0	2.5e+09	0	A potent weather system stalled over southeast Louisiana from the evening of May 8 through mid day of May 10 producing two bouts of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms.  The first event occurred the evening of May 8 and early morning of May 9 producing several tornadoes and widespread heavy rain of 8 to 15 inches across the greater New Orleans metro area into southeast St. Tammany Parish.  The second bout of severe weather struck during the evening of May 9 and continued into the morning of May 10, producing rainfall of 10 to 15 inches primarily from St. Tammany Parish into south Mississippi.  Drainage capacity was overwhelmed by the torrential rainfall on each of these nights and water flooded tens of thousands of homes in southeast Louisiana.  By early June, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported approximately 60,000 addresses representing single family units,  multifamily units, and businesses had filed for assistance due to weather damage.  In late May, the Red Cross estimated 36,000 homes in southeast Louisiana were affected by flood water.  Newspaper accounts indicated weather related damage to reach the $2.5 to $3.0 billion range.  Parish by parish detail follows. 
211887	1994-02-09	ICE STORM	MS	0	0	5e+05	5e+09	During the early morning hours on the 9th, freezing rain began falling over north Mississippi and continued through mid-day on the 10th.  Ice accumulation of three to six inches were common over the affected area. Due to the weight of the ice, power lines, trees and tree limbs were downed.  Many trees fell on houses and automobiles.  The ice storm cause significant damage to approximately 3.7 million  acres of commercial forestland.  The value of damaged timber was estimated to be $1.3 billion.  In addition to the damage of commercial timber was the damage to urban trees, estimated to be $27 million.  Twenty five percent of the states pecan crop will be lost for the next five to ten years at an estimated cost of $5.5 million per year. Nearly 750,000 customers were with out power in the affected area. Customers were without power for up to a month.  Over eight thousand  utility poles were pulled down by the weight of the ice.  Over 4,700 miles of power lines were down. Four-hundred-ninety-one water systems were affected  with around 741,000 customers without water.  Estimates of damage to utilities will run nearly $500 million.  This is the worst ice storm to strike Mississippi since a severe ice storm struck the state in January 1951.  
213238	1995-06-07	THUNDERSTORM WINDS	MO	0	0	1.4e+08	0	The roof of the New Haven Police Department and radio tower suffered extensive damage.  Large trees were also blown down and uprooted in the Leslie and Gerald areas.

220960	1995-07-04	FLASH FLOOD	NC	0	0	6.8e+08	0	Up to eight inches of rain in a three hour period caused the worst flash flood ever along the Meherrin River in the town of Severn. Between 15 and 20 residences were damaged significantly by the flood, with water window high in many of these homes. Damage also occurred at the local sewage treatment plant. 
223436	1994-02-08	ICE STORM	OH	1	1568	5e+07	5e+06	The worst ice storm in recent memory struck southern Ohio. Heavy freezing rain fell across the counties near the Ohio River and heavy sleet mixed in across the central counties. Ice accumulations averaged three-quarter to two inches. Thunderstorms with heavy freezing rain occurred over parts of southern Ohio the evening of the 8th. Trees, including numerous fruit trees, and power lines were downed and damaged in many southern Ohio communities. Supplies of salt, already low from previous storms, were used up by many communities hindering ice removal. Temperatures during and after the storm remained quite cold, in the teens and single digits, also slowing ice removal. Travel on foot and by vehicle was treacherous. The extended cold, the inability to remove all the ice, and school closings (some schools were closed through the 11th) produced a record number of injuries, mostly due to falls and sledding accidents. Most were broken bones. At least a half dozen traffic fatalities occurred and one death can be directly attributed to the weather. A Middletown (Butler) man, age 40, died of exposure. Some freezing drizzle lingered into the 9th. 
242094	1995-04-29	HAILSTORM	TX	0	0	2.2e+08	0	Large hail did approximately $220,000,000 in damage across eastern Tarrant County from Grapevine and DFW airport areas southward across the eastern part of Arlington. 
243394	1995-05-05	SEVERE THUNDERSTORM	TX	0	0	1.2e+09	0	Just after 1730 CDT, a thunderstorm developed rapidly on the Palo Pinto/Parker County line ahead of an intense squall line over the western part of north Texas.  This storm quickly became severe, producing hail up to golf ball-size 18 inches deep across southern parts of Parker County, and flash flooding resulting in two deaths. The storm continued to intensify as it moved into Tarrant County around 1900 CDT, producing baseball-size hail in Benbrook.  As the storm moved east-northeast across Fort Worth, softball-size hail was reported at many locations.  At Mayfest, a large outdoor festival located at Trinity Park in Fort Worth, an estimated 10,000 people were caught in the open with little available shelter.  Hail up to softball-size injured many people.  The storm continued moving east-northeast across Tarrant County producing large hail, wind damage, and flash flooding producing rainfall, with one flash flood death.  At 1948 CDT, as the storm began moving into Dallas County, the squall line that was to the west merged with the severe thunderstorm.  This merger resulted in record rainfall and massive flash flooding the remainder of the night across Dallas County, with 17 people drowned and many stranded by high water.  Total estimated damage across Parker, Tarrant, and Dallas counties, from this storm, is estimated at over $1.2 billion, the costliest thunderstorm event in the history of the United States.

251558	1996-05-22	HAIL	CO	0	0	1.2e+08	0	A severe thunderstorm producing large hail ranging in size from 3/4 to 2 inches in diameter rumbled across the northwest and northern portions of the Denver metropolitan area.  The thunderstorm apparently developed from an outflow boundary generated from the supercell thunderstorm that moved across extreme northeastern Colorado earlier in the evening.  The storm developed near the foothills and moved east northeast across northern portions of the metro area.   The hardest hit areas were cities of Arvada and Westminster, northwest of Denver.  The insurance industry estimated $60 million in damage to homes and personal property and $62 million in damage to automobiles for a total of $122 million in insured losses.  This estimate also included the cities of Golden, Thornton and Wheat Ridge.  It was the fourth worst hailstorm in the last 10 years.    
267684	1996-07-12	HURRICANE	NC	1	10	140250000	1.27e+08	Hurricane Bertha slammed into the North Carolina coastline between Surf City and North Topsail Beach causing severe damage to property, utilities and roads.  Hardest hit were agricultural crops which suffered losses in excess of $126 million.  Heaviest damage was in Topsail Beach and all of Onslow County up the coast to Emerald Isle in Carteret County.  In Onslow alone, 199 structures were destroyed (117 were mobile homes).  An 8-10 foot storm surge struck Swansboro and Emerald Isle.  Several businesses were flooded.  Water flowed through the streets of Belhaven in Beaufort County where the surge was around 7 feet.  In New Bern, numerous boats were sunk or damaged at 3 private marinas.  Fishing piers were demolished all along the coast.  New River (Marine Corps Air Station in Jacksonville) reported a peak wind gust of 108 mph.  Rainfall across the region ranged from 8 inches in the Hofman Forest (Onslow) to 6 1/2 inches in Broad Creek to over 5 1/2 in Snow Hill and Washington.  F29VE
267880	1996-09-04	HURRICANE	NC	4	4	792150000	0	Hurricane Fran moved onshore near Cape Fear Thursday evening (9/6) and raced north toward Raleigh cutting a swath of destruction.  The Category 3 hurricane destroyed or damaged 90% of the homes in North Topsail Beach.  The town hall and police station were destroyed.  A 15 foot storm surge cut a 100-foot-wide inlet through thye middle of the island.  A Camp Lejeune-based Marine lost his life when he and two others mistakenly drove onto the island at the height of the storm.  State Route 1568 was washed out and NC210 was covered with sand.  Damage in North Topsail and Onslow County alone exceeds $500 million as 6,688 structures were destroyed or damaged.  In Carteret County, Emerald Isle reported 67 homes destroyed and 409 with major damage.  Thirty-three mobile homes were destroyed.  The Emerald Isle fishing pier was destroyed, and Bogue Sound Pier lost 150 feet.  Erosion along the dunes ranged from 5 to 20 feet.  Winds gusted to 100 mph at Atlantic Beach.  Storm surge in Swansboro was measured at 10 feet.  Several businesses along the waterfront were destroyed and water covered Main Street.  Storm surges approaching 9 feet flooded portions of Washington and Belhaven.  The storm surge in Washington was the highest since the September 3, 1912 unnamed hurricane.  New Bern had a storm surge on the Neuse River of 10 feet.  One bridge was closed when an approach road collapsed.  Other bridges were out near Stella and Swansboro.

271489	1996-02-06	FLOOD	OR	7	0	4e+08	0	Runoff from heavy rains and melting mountain snow caused major floods upon many northern Oregon rivers.  The first rivers reached flood stage on the morning of February 6th while the heaviest rain was still falling. flooding was measured on twenty one rivers in northwestern Oregon. Six rivers set all time high river stage records, and 7 people lost their lives as a direct result of flooding. In eastern Oregon 4 rivers experienced significant flooding. Many smaller un-gaged streams also left their banks during this period. Statewide damage was estimated at over 285 million dollars with an estimated five thousand homes destroyed. Most rivers had receeded to below flood stage by February 14th, however the Lower Willamette river fluctuated around flood stage and the lower reaches of the Columbia remained above flood stage until the end of February.

275399	1996-04-19	HAIL	TX	0	0	2e+08	0	A large supercell thunderstorm moved across the area producing widespread hail to softball size. Substantial damage was done at the airport and across the northern half of the city. Cooperate buildings sustained major hail damage, windows were broken, and many roofs were damaged.
277024	1996-08-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	12600000	189680000	Toward the latter part of August plentiful rains were at last falling over all of the area.  This pattern was started by the tropical plume that brought Hurricane Dolly westward through the Bay of Campeche to near Tampico, Mexico, across the Central America to where she dissipated in the eastern North Pacific.  Although Dolly was over 1000 miles south of the area, this same plume of deep, tropical moisture locked over Southwest Texas and rained over much of the area on a daily basis through the end of the month. Since a drought is a very loosely defined phenomenon, there is no explicit beginning or end, but for the purposes of Storm Data there is no room for flexibility--only qualifications that can be made in this narrative.  The effects in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico were mainly in the form of crop damage due to the dry weather.  Those farms that were able to plant crops late in the season were able to grow crops successfully.  With the threat to crops ending in August and the Eastern Pacific cold phase waning, it was felt that a definite trend away from the drought had begun.  Many people would argue that the drought lasted through the end of 1996 as four years of dry weather could not be corrected in one week, but from a meteorological standpoint as to precipitation patterns, significant changes had occurred during the 1996 Summer that were expected to continue indefinitely;  therefore, the drought will be ended here. During the afternoon of August 23 showers and thunderstorms developed, thereby beginning the long journey toward a wetter regime over Southwest Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. During the drought, extreme failures of crops and pastureland were reported.  Due to the lack of grasses for cattle about half of the cattle in the region had to be sold early.  This flooding of the cattle market sent cattle prices plummeting.  In a few locations, wells dried up making irrigation impossible. The commodity losses follow: Cotton           $162,275,000 Rangeland          24,744,000  Grain Sorghum       2,400,000 Wheat                 530,000 Peanuts                59,300 Rangeland/Pastureland losses were incurred as stunted grasses made ranchers slash the lease prices for their property grazing rights. The property damage was solely due to the cattle market.  With the stunted grass growth, there was not enough food to feed cattle.  About half of the cattle in the region (90,000) had to be auctioned due to this feed shortage.  With this flood of the auction market the beef prices plummeted.  The $12,600,000 figure was the estimated loss by ranchers having to sell their cattle in a deflated market.  A county-by-county assessment was not available, so the total was entered in the first county that sustained losses.  The greatest cattle losses were probably in the large counties west of the Pecos River, where almost all of the land is rangeland and there are very few farms. In the listing of crop damage, some of the counties were listed as $0.00 damage.  This listing is because these counties were grouped with an adjacent county in the available reports.  Loving County is listed with Reeves County, Terrell County with Brewster County, and Jeff Davis County with Presidio County. Two counties in the area, Lea, NM and Culberson, TX reported that there were no drought conditions in their counties. The grand total for damage to crops and property in 22 Texas counties and 1 New Mexico county stands at approximately $205 Million.  Undoubtedly there are some other factors that have not been considered, but the most significant damages according to the agriculture experts are listed in this report.
282143	1997-09-25	TROPICAL STORM	AZ	0	0	0	2e+08	An estimated $150 to $200 million in damage was sustained by crops throughout Yuma County due mainly to flooded crops. About $30 to $40 million was to lemon trees. The heavy rain was attributed to Tropical Storm Nora. 
282264	1997-03-01	TORNADO	AR	6	100	1.2e+08	0	The tornado moved out of Nevada County and into Clark County approximately 6.5 miles south of Okolona at 220 pm CST.  The tornado continued moving northeastward, causing considerable tree damage and downing a number of power lines.  The first fatality occurred along I-30, several miles southwest of Arkadelphia where a vehicle was blown off the highway and the driver was killed.  A truck-stop was also destroyed near this location as well.  At 242 pm CST, the tornado moved into the City of Arkadelphia.  A number of homes and businesses in Arkadelphia were either damaged or destroyed.  5 people in Arkadelphia were also killed.  The tornado continued to move northeastward, knocking down more trees and power lines, as well as damaging more homes.  The tornado exited Clark County approximately 3.5 miles northeast of Arkadelphia at 247 pm CST. Damage along the track of the tornado was mostly F2 to F3.  However, some timber and structural damage along the path was consistent with an F4 rating.  M45VE, F45BU, M37MH, F45MH, F14PH, F14PH

282863	1997-01-01	FLOOD	CA	1	0	1.9e+08	0	Heavy rainfall on a much above normal snowpack subsequently led to floods in the Southern Sierra Nevada as well as the adjacent San Joaquin Valley.  Especially hard hit was Yosemite National Park as the Merced River ran over 80-year historical record high water marks.  The water level reached 23.45' on the Pohono Bridge gauging station measuring 24,600 CFS of water discharge as compared to a normal height for the time of year near 3.5'.  The crest of the flooding occurred very late on January 2nd lingering well into the morning of the 3rd.  One drowning fatality occurred in Mariposa County as a vehicle was swept from a roadway through the Chowchilla River.  Huge water flows, upward to 90,000 CFS, coursed through the streams and rivers leading into Millerton Lake with similar amounts on the Merced River into Lake McClure during January 3rd.  Damage by County and type within CA Zone 22: Yosemite National Park; Damage to park trails, roads, sewer and water systems, and housing $178M. Mariposa County; Damage to county roads and property $8.5M; one fatality at 7:20 PM PST on January 2nd. Madera County; No damage assessed in mountain areas. Fresno County; Highway 180 was damaged along 7 miles of road into Cedar Grove going into Kings National Park plus bridge damage near Big Creek $1.8M.

283730	1997-07-28	FLASH FLOOD	CO	5	40	1.9e+08	0	A flash flood killed 5 women and injured 40 others when a 10-15 foot wall of water surged through 2 mobile home parks.  Over 8 inches of rainfall was measured in southwest Fort Collins during the evening hours as a series of storms developed, dumping heavy rain over the same  area.  The disaster occurred when debris apparently blocked a culvert beneath the railroad tracks adjacent to the park which flowed into Spring Creek.  The normally small creek became a torrent when the dammed water jumped the railroad tracks.  The highwater also derailed 4 railroad cars, compounding the catastrophe.  The wall of water swept through the mobile home park destroying 108 homes and damaging 481 others, 86 severely.  Four women were killed while attempting to evacuate there homes and flee the floodwaters.  Another died when she tried to go back into the park to rescue her pets.   Torrential rainfall caused extensive flooding at the Colorado State University campus.  The library was hardest hit as 500,000 books were damaged, nearly half beyond repair.  Highwaters from the surrounding area filled the basement with 10 feet of water, destroying the medical archives.  Total damage estimates throughout the Fort Collins area were approximately $190 million.  A  breakdown of the estimated damages included;  $125-$135 million to the CSU campus,  $50 million to homes, primarily mobile homes,  $2.5 million to city roads,  businesses and public buildings, and $2.0 million in automobile claims.

283783	1997-08-11	FLASH FLOOD	CO	0	0	1.28e+08	0	Large hail, strong winds and torrential rain hammered portions of Lakewood and South Denver.  Nearly 1 inch of rain fell in the span of 10 minutes in South Denver with a storm total of 1.81 inches reported.  Street flooding was extensive as gutters and other drainage systems in the area were clogged by hail, piled several inches deep, as well as other debris.   In addition, extensive damage to cars, homes and businesses was reported as strong thunderstorm winds to 50 mph and large hail accompanied the heavy rain.  Several trees were downed by the strong winds and trees stripped of their leaves by the hail.  A water lily exhibition on display at the Denver Botanic Gardens was heavily damaged.   Final estimates of the damage included $60 million to automobiles with another $68 million to homes and businesses.

Damage attributed to river flooding alone was at 115 million across Jefferson county Kentucky bringing the total damage across the county to 200 million including the earlier flash flooding and flooding. McAlpine Lock at Louisville climbed over flood stage late Sunday evening March 2 and crested at 38.8 feet on the upper gauge (flood stage is 23 feet) at 5 am est March 7 and on the lower gauge at 70.6 feet (flood stage is 55 feet) at 6 pm est on March 7. At other spots, at Clifty Creek, Indiana, the river crested at 460.9 feet (flood stage is 450 feet) at 7 am est March 7. At Cannelton, Indiana, the river crested at a record 52.3 feet (flood stage is 42 feet) at 2 am est on March 8. At Tell City, the river crested at 50.4 (flood stage is 38.0 feet) feet at 5 am est March 8.  Some of the hardest hit communities were Louisville, West Point in Hardin county, Milton in Trimble county, Westport in Oldham county and Utica and Jeffersonville in Clark county Indiana. Among other things seen floating down the fast current of the river were houses and tractor trailers. A 39 year old man was found floating down the river near West Point. Barge traffic was brought to a stand still all along the river from Monday March 3. 29 miles of flood walls were installed around the Louisville metro area making it appear as a fortress.  West Point is a town of 1,300 located at the confluence of the Ohio River and the Salt River. The Salt River reached the 32 foot flood stage just after 1 am est on Sunday March 2. It then crested at 40.9 feet at 1 pm est Monday March 3. The whole town of West Point was evacuated after becoming an island covered by water up to the roof tops in spots. The towns of Milton, Utica and Westport also saw the Ohio River cover them with at least knee-deep water from the Ohio. All in all, numerous roads across south central Indiana and north central Kentucky were water covered and closed from Saturday March 1 through Wednesday March 12. Many businesses were also well under water along the Ohio. President Clinton granted federal aid to all the counties along the Ohio river by declaring them disaster areas. Here are some of the damage reports across the southern Indiana counties: Jefferson county had 120 homes receive major damage. In Clark county, 500 residents at Utica and 75 residents in Clarksville were evacuated. About 100 homes had major damage. In Clarksville, flooding along Silver Creek caused most of the damage. In Floyd county, around 100 people were evacuated. In Harrison county, around 200 homes and businesses were damaged with 10 residents evacuated in Corydon. In Crawford county, Leavenworth and Alton had minor evacuations. In Perry county, 100 people were evacuated.     M39IW 
292428	1997-04-17	FLOOD	MN	0	0	6e+08	0	The Red River crested in East Grand Forks on the 21st/22nd just over 54 feet, shattering the previous record by over 5 feet.  Problems with the river gauge led to difficulties in obtaining stages.  The 9,000 residents of East Grand Forks were evacuated from their homes on the 18th and 19th, due to the failure of the city dikes.  Many homes were completely submerged in water.  All of the bridges to Grand Forks were covered with water.  Schools in East Grand Forks were cancelled for the remainder of the year.  The Red Lake River set a new record in Crookston on the 17th, causing hundreds of people to evacuate their homes. 
296001	1997-01-01	FLOOD	NV	2	50	6.4e+08	0	The floods of January l997 were caused by several factors.  First, the Sierra and western Nevada had experienced two above normal precipitation years (1995, 1996).  Second, a major winter storm December 21st and 22nd 1996 deposited heavy snow in the Sierra and western Nevada.  Four to six feet of snow was common below 7000 feet in the Sierra with up to eight feet at the higher elevations.  One to three feet of snow was found across the valleys of western Nevada.  The following week into New Years' Day showed a dramatic change in the weather pattern.  Copious amounts of moisture and warm air were transported from the subtropics into the Sierra and western Nevada.  The heaviest rainfall occurred Janaury lst and 2nd, and snow levels were as high as 11,700 feet on the 1st. An incredible amount of rainfall and snowmelt runoff poured out of the Sierra Nevada from December 30, 1996 to January 6, 1997.  For example, an estimated 25 inches of rain and snowmelt runoff occurred during the period on the Squaw Creek Basin (in the upper Truckee River Basin in Placer County, California) during this period.  This scenario was typical throughout the region and resulted in extensive flooding on the Truckee, Carson, Walker, and Susan Rivers.  Record flooding occurred on much of the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Basins.  This flooding caused tremendous amounts of public and private damage throughout the eastern Sierra and extreme western Nevada. A winter storm on January 22nd again dropped heavy amounts of snow in the Sierra and the valleys of western Nevada but not as much as the December storm.  This storm was followed by another significant storm January 24th through the 26th which aggravated flooding along the Truckee and Carson Rivers.  However, this storm system was much colder than the New Years' storm.  Snow levels were around 6500-7000 feet in the Sierra and western Nevada, minimizing the amount of snowmelt from the higher elevations.  Thus, river stages were much lower than the New Years' flooding.  The main result was urban and small stream flooding. The following information provides details of damages, deaths, and injuries caused by flooding in the Reno County Warning Forecast Area (CWFA).  The CWFA includes parts of the eastern Sierra and western Nevada. NVZ005-CAZ070 Northern Washoe County Nevada and Surprise Valley California There were no reports of damage in Northern Washoe County Nevada.  However, parts of Surprise Valley California were inundated by heavy rainfall, causing mud and debris from mountain and hill sides to slide into homes in the community of Lake City (north of Cedarville).  Also, parts of County Road One were either covered by mud or washed out.  Estimated damage to the road was about $1.5 million.  Estimated damage to area homes was about $500,000. CAZ071 Lassen...Eastern Plumas...and Eastern Sierra Counties The greatest damage due to flooding occurred in Plumas County.  $90,000 in damage was done in the city of Portola alone.  The most extensive damage was to homes, bridges, and roadways.  Flooding and rain caused a 50 foot section of Highway 70 to crumble between Blairsden and Sloat.  There was also extensive damage to railroad infrastructure.  Damage amounts were as follows: 1) public facilities $60 million, 2) private owners and businesses $10 million (50 homes reported damage), and 3) Federal Highway System $21.2 million (which includes severe damage to Highway 70).  For Lassen County, damage amounts were as follows:  1) public facilites not available, 2) private owners and businesses $500,000, and 3) Federal Highway System $1 million.  Finally, there was one injury reported in Sierra County.  Sierra County estimated damage to private owners, businesses, and public facilities at $2 million.  The Federal Highway System destruction was near $25.6 million (incudes damage to Highway 49). NVZ002-CAZ072 The Greater Lake Tahoe Area The Greater Lake Tahoe experienced extensive damage due to flooding rivers, streams, and mudslides.  There was so much rain and melted snow that Lake Tahoe was pushed over its legal limit by 3.5 inches, reaching an altitude of 6,229.39 feet on January 5th.  This was the highest elevation of the lake since July 17, 1917.  Each county that lies within this zone is examined below: Placer County:  Flooding in this county eroded away mountain sides which broke sewer and power lines.  Serious damage occurred at Squaw Valley Lodge, a separately owned facility behind the Squaw Valley Ski Area main entrance.  The south fork of Squaw Creek jumped its bank and burst through the lodge.  This destroyed many units in the lodge as well as depositing thick mud.  Many public roads, bridges, and other infrastructure were affected by the floods, especially along the Truckee River.  All bridges across Highway 89 were destroyed or severely damaged.  Damage estimates for public property was near $11 million.  137 homes and 22 businesses were damaged.  Total damage to private homes, businesses, agricultural losses, and private roads was near $10 million.  Destruction to the Federal Highway System was near $7.7 million which includes widespread damage to Highway 89. Nevada County:  Property along the Truckee River, Donner Creek, and Trout Creek was severely damaged.  On the Truckee River, two small bridges were ripped out and several others were under water.  Mudslides closed several major roads and Union Pacific railroad tracks.  Estimated damage to public facilities was $5 million.  100 homes and 40 businesses were damaged, costing an estimated $20 million.  Federal Highway System damage was about $3.9 million. El Dorado County:  The Upper Truckee River reached its highest level ever on January 2nd.  The National Weather Service does not have a flood stage here, and there is no telemetry on the gage.  The American River west of Echo Summit tore away a number of bridges that provided access to summer homes.  U.S. Highway 50 received extensive damage from water undermining sections and also from mud slides.  One injury was reported when a boulder dislodged by a saturated hillside slammed into a truck.  A 43 year old woman received serious head injuries.  Estimated damage in El Dorado County was as follows:  1) public facilites $17 million, 2) private owners and businesses $5 million, and 3) Federal Highway System $40.5 million.  This incudes severe damage to U.S. Highway 50.  Most of the damage was not in the Reno CWFA. Alpine County:  The most damage in this county was to the Federal Highway System which was estimated at $5.5 million.  Public damage was projected to be near $400,000. The following shows selected crests at certain sites along the Truckee River in Placer and Nevada Counties and the east and west forks of the Carson River in Alpine County: River/Location      Flood State       Maximum Crest (feet) and Date Truckee River near      4.5 ft          9.97 ft (11,900 cfs) on  Truckee, CA                             1/2/97*.

NVZ001-003-004 MINERAL AND SOUTHERN LYON COUNTIES...THE GREATER RENO-CARSON CITY-MINDEN AREA...WESTERN NEVADA BASIN AND RANGE Flood devastation was widespread across western Nevada.  Most of the damage occurred from the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Rivers early in January.  As reported by the American Red Cross, two deaths and at least 50 injuries occurred in western Nevada (four of the injuries required hospitalization).  The Truckee and Carson Rivers crested above flood stage again later in the month (Janaury 25th and 26th), but the flooding was much less than the record flooding at the beginning of the month.  Each county within Nevada zones one, three, and four is analyzed below: Mineral County:  Only minor damage occurred here.  Estimated cost was $2,400. Pershing County:  No damage was reported here as the flooding rivers mentioned above do not flow into this county. Churchill County:  Damage to the public facilities (including public buildings, utilities, and roads) was about $30,000.  Total private damage was estimated at $315,000 of which $267,000 was to the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District facilties. Carson City:  The mainstem Carson river in combination with swollen creeks and streams flowing from the eastern Sierra caused extensive damage in the Carson City area.  The heavy rains of January 1st and 2nd deluged parts of Carson City, forcing the closure of roads and businesses.  Damage to public facilities was about $6.4 million.  Damage to homes and businesses was not available at the time of this documentation. Storey County:  There was damage done to public and private property in Storey County, both on the mainstem Truckee and on small streams.  Estimated public damage was about $2 million.  This includes the destruction of five bridges on the Truckee, two miles of levees, and Six Mile Canyon Road.  Damage to private owners and businesses was about $1 million.  This includes $500,000 to the Mustang Ranch and $125,000 to three homes. Lyon County:  Widespread devastation occurred in the towns of Dayton (from the Carson River), Wellington and Smith (from the West Walker River), and Yerington (from the mainstem Walker River).  The greatest destruction was inflicted on the town of Yerington.  Over 250 homes received extensive damage from flood waters.  Estimated damage for private property in Yerington alone was near $15 million.  Over 30 homes were damaged in the Wellington and Smith areas, bringing damage estimates here to $1.5 million.  Damage to public facilities in the county was over $3 million.  Parts of Highway 208 and 339 in the Wilson Canyon area were completely washed away.  Damage to agricultural land was widespread, but losses will not be known for some time. Douglas County:  The raging Carson River caused massive destruction to homes and levees.  Over 75 homes in the Minden/Gardnerville area were known to receive damage estimated at $5 million.  Public damage, especially to the Carson Valley levee and irrigation system, will likely exceed $50 million.  U.S. Highway 395 and Highway 88 were inundated with water, isolating residents in the Minden/Gardnerville area for several days.  There was one death attributed to the flooding in Gardnerville.  A 59 year old man was swept into the East Carson River while operating a front-end loader near its banks. Washoe County:  Devastation was immense in this county due to the concentration of businesses and homes along the Truckee River.  Estimated damage to 1,420 businesses and homes in the city of Reno was near $200 million.  Four major casinos had to close during the climax of the flood, including the Reno Hilton which received $15 million in damage (a part of the total $200 million calculated for the city).  Parks and recreational facilities along the Truckee River in Washoe County were either damaged or ruined, costing about $3.2 million.  The Reno-Tahoe International Airport also took a heavy blow from flooding.  Runways and parts of the terminal building were submerged in water.  Consequently, there was extensive damage to the east-west runway and the terminal building.  Cost to repair the airport was calculated near $32 million.  Sparks, just east of Reno, was also devastated.  The Sparks industrial park was flooded by the Truckee River.  In some parts of the industrial area, standing water reached as high as six feet.  Damage to homes and businesses in the city of Sparks was estimated near $300 million.  One death occurred in Sparks.  A 53 year old man was believed to have been swept into the Truckee River.  He apparently went to his place of business in order to retrieve some personal belongings.  The road to his business was washed away, and it was surmised that he and his truck were swept into the Truckee River. In addition to the homes and businesses damaged, roads in Washoe County were also affected by erosion and mudslides.  Three mudslides closed Highway 43l (Mt. Rose Highway) between the Mt. Rose Ski area and the 8,9ll foot summit for several days.  Interstate 80 near the California border was smothered by a mudslide, closing the area to commuters for a period of time on January 2nd.  A part of the westbound lane of Interstate 80 in Sparks was closed for several days when flood waters eroded the south wall of the nearby Helm's Gravel Pit.  Heavy flooding on the south side of the interstate forced water to flow in the opposite direction and into the Helm's Gravel Pit, eroding the banks of the pit to a depth exceeding one hundred feet.  This caused the nearby westbound lane to collapse.  Cost to repair the interstate was near $2.5 million.  Finally, U.S. Highway 395 in Washoe Valley was covered by water for two days, closing the main link between Reno and Carson City.  Total damage to the Federal Highway System in Washoe County alone was about $5 million.  Overall damage to the Federal Highway System in the state of Nevada was estimated over $13 million.

CAZ073 MONO COUNTY CALIFORNIA The floods of January l997 did not spare Mono County.  Heavy rains with high snow levels produced disastrous results.  For example, the town of Mammoth Lakes reported about eight inches of rain in a 36 hour period (January lst and 2nd).  This same intensity was common across the eastern Sierra in Mono County, causing a rapid rise to rivers, creeks, and streams.  In fact, the West Walker River became a powerful torrent of water which caused massive destruction.  Damage from flooding was found in the towns of Mammoth Lakes, Coleville, Walker, and Topaz.  111 homes and 4 businesses were destroyed by the floods, totaling at least $25 million in damage.  Destruction to public facilities (including national monuments) was near $5 million.  Above all, extensive damage was done to the Federal Highway System.  In fact, a 12 mile stretch of U.S. Highway 395 (roughly between Topaz and Sonora Junction at Highway 108) was completely destroyed by the West Walker River.  The cost for repairs was estimated at $20 million.  Total damage to the Federal Highway System in the county was near $48 million. The following shows river information near Coleville, California for the West Walker River: River/Location          Flood Stage     Maximum Stage and Crest West Walker below          5.5 ft       10.06 ft (11,700 cfs) on Little Walker near                      1/2/97 was a record Coleville, CA                           stage/flow.

298050	1997-04-05	BLIZZARD	ND	1	0	1.02e+08	0	With falling temperatures on the back side of the low, the freezing rain turned to ice pellets and then to snow.  A strong pressure gradient created winds up to 65 mph, dropping visibilities down to zero.  The strong wind, on top of heavy ice accumulations, caused thousands of power poles to snap.  This cut power to over 100,000 people in eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota and resulted in $30 million in damages just to the power infrastructure.  A 2,060 foot television tower collapsed near Galesburg on April 5th.  With power cut, many people had to seek shelters with generator power in order to keep warm.  Some smaller communities were without power for more than a week.  Most television and radio stations were knocked off the air, causing one Fargo radio station to become the only source of storm news for the area.  In Grand Forks, 3 inches of ice pellets fell, and as the wind increased, one foot drifts of ice pellets were created.  Snowfall totals on the 6th ranged around 7 inches.  Interstates 29 and 94 were both closed in North Dakota, along with US Highway 2 from Lakota to Grand Forks.  A 33 year-old Lankin man died from exposure, after walking away from his stalled vehicle.  The blizzard was especially tough on livestock, with thousands reported dead.  The governor of North Dakota declared the state a disaster area on the 6th, with a Presidential disaster declaration coming on the 7th.   M33OU 
298054	1997-04-16	FLOOD	ND	0	0	1.5e+08	0	The cresting Red River caused numerous problems to the Hickson and Fargo areas.  Numerous homes along the river were flooded, as the river rose to a new record for the century on the 18th, at 39.55 feet.  Overland flooding caused problems along the south and southwest sides of Fargo, as water from the Wild Rice River broke out of its banks and headed overland toward Fargo.  The water flowed over Interstate 29 near the Horace exit.  A clay dike was built along the south side of the city to prevent this water from flooding thousands of homes.  A section was also cut out of US Highway 81 to relieve the water level along the south side of Fargo.  
298057	1997-04-18	FLOOD	ND	0	0	3e+09	0	The Red River reached a new record level in Grand Forks, just over 54 feet, on April 21st/22nd, shattering the previous record by over 5 feet.  Problems with the river gauge led to difficulties in obtaining stages.  One flow measurement, taken close to the crest, indicated 145,000 cfs in the Red River.  The city dikes failed on the 18th and 19th, forcing the 50,000 residents to evacuate their homes.  Roughly 70 percent of the city of Grand Forks was flooded, with some homes completely submerged.  Fire struck downtown Grand Forks on the 19th, burning 11 buildings to the ground.  Firefighters could not reach the downtown area, due to the height of the river, so forest firefighters were called in with helicopters.  All of the bridges across the river to East Grand Forks were under water, making Fargo the only crossing point from Fargo to Canada.  As the river remained high for several weeks, the University of North Dakota and all other schools in Grand Forks cancelled the rest of the school year.  The city had no drinking water for 3 weeks, as the water treatment plant was flooded.  
309890	1998-03-08	FLASH FLOOD	AL	4	0	1.05e+08	0	A vigorous Gulf storm dumped up to 14 inches of rain across the northern half of Coffee County.  The earthen levee on the Beaver Dam Creek breached.  A six foot wall of water rushed into the city of Elba.  Two thousand residents were forced to evacuate.  Nearly 400 homes and businesses sustained flood damage.  Approximately 52 county roads were washed out or flooded.  The Pea River at Elba crested near 39.3 feet on March 9.  Four people were killed when their vehicles were swept away by floodwaters.  Coffee County was declared a federal disaster area. M5VE, M17VE, M59VE, F4VE
309893	1998-03-08	FLOOD	AL	0	0	2.3e+08	0	An intense Gulf storm deposited up to 14 inches of rain across southeast Alabama on March 6-8.  Houston, Dale, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.  In Geneva County, runoff from torrential rains in Coffee and Dale counties pushed the Chotawhatchee River out of its banks.  Resultant flooding the week of March 8 damaged 85 homes, washed out many of the county roads and closed State Highway 27 south from Geneva.  An estimated 300 residents were without water.  Communities suffering the worst damage were Malvern, Slocomb, Geneva, and Samson.  The Choctawhatchee River at Geneva crested near 39.3 feet on March 9.  In Houston County, 60 roads were closed.  At Cottonwood, several families were evacuated.  Approximately 175 homes sustained flood damage.  In Dale County, numerous county and state roads were flooded.  Between 300 and 400 homes were damaged.  The Choctawhatchee River at Newton crested near 34.6 feet (third highest) on March 9.  In Henry County,  flood damage to county roads alone was estimated near $440,000.

The tornado moved through primarily rural and unpopulated areas of eastern Tuscaloosa County before crossing into extreme southwestern Jefferson County.  The tornado remained in primarily unpopulated area until just before reaching Oak Grove community where three deaths occurred in a mobile home.  The tornado destroyed the Oak Grove School and a number of other buildings including a fire department as it cross CR 23/54. The tornado moved into unpopulated area for a short while before crossing CR 54 (Lock 17 Road/Warrior River Road) where numerous houses and other structures were damaged and destroyed including another volunteer fire department building.  Eleven deaths were reported in this area. The tornado crossed Rock Creek just west of Rock Creek Road, a steep, hilly unpopulated area.  The tornado path then moved into a fairly densely populated area all the way until it dissipated in Pratt City.  Areas affected included Pinedale Estates, McGregor Estates, Rockwood, Sylvan Springs, Wylam Heights, Edgewater, McDonald Chapel, Minor, West Ensley, and Pratt City. Pratt City is also within the city limits of Birmingham.  Four deaths occurred in Sylvan Springs, two in Wylam Heights, nine in Edgewater, two in McDonald Chapel, and one in West Ensley. According to American Red Cross surveys, 608 homes were destroyed, 556 sustained major damage, and another 810 had minor damage.  There were 1,164 families with homes that were unlivable. Forest service officials estimated 4,000 acres of timber was destoyed in Jefferson County and 1,000 acres in Tuscaloosa County.
310571	1998-09-25	HURRICANE	AL	1	0	174160000	5e+06	For the second time in less than a month, the area was again threatened by a hurricane.  Hurricane Georges affected the region September 25 through the 29.  The coastal areas from Dauphin Island to east of Destin were put under a hurricane watch at 900 AM CST, September 25.  A hurricane warning was issued for the area at 900 AM CST, September 26.  The hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning for the area at 300 PM CST, September 28.  All tropical storm warnings for the area were dropped at 900 AM CST, September 29. Georges made landfall along the Mississippi coast near Biloxi between 300 and 500 AM CST, September 28. Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama and Northwest Florida were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 55 knots.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 58 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained winds of 40 knots, gusts 61 knots.  Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots. Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport. Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches. Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet. Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm. Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks. It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.   One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working. Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49. Throughout the area, agriculture took a beating with the cotton, soybean and pecan crop almost totally destroyed. Preliminary damage estimates in Southwest Alabama were 174.2 million dollars, in Northwest Florida 135 million dollars and in Southeast Mississippi 72 million dollars.  F43OU
312672	1998-05-01	HEAVY RAIN	CA	0	0	0	2e+08	Continued abnormally wet weather during the month of May caused huge crop and livestock losses in not only San Joaquin County, but many counties in the Central Valley.  However, only San Joaquin County had preliminary estimates available.  Crop losses due to record or near record rain during the period February 1998 to May 1998 in interior northern California may total in the billions.
312976	1998-12-20	EXTREME COLD	CA	0	0	0	5.96e+08	On December 19th an arctic airmass began moving over Central California.  The resulting cold air pool from advection and radiational cooling in the lowest levels of the atmosphere led to a devastating freeze to crops, especially citrus, in the Central and Southern San Joaquin Valley from December 20th through 27th.  Estimates of direct crop loss reached $596M for the Central and Southern San Joaquin Valley with an indirect economic loss estimated at $2.7B to local area economies.  The largest percentage of area crop losses were to lemons and oranges but several other unharvested fruit and vegetable crops, including avocados and broccoli, also suffered widespread damage.  Mornings of freezing temperatures lasted from the 20th through the 30th but the coldest mornings of concern to agriculture generally ended on the 27th.  On the morning of the 23rd, for example, minimum temperatures dropped to the 16-24 deg F. range with time durations less than 28 deg F. in excess of 16 hours in many locations.  Fresno had a record low maximum temperature of only 34 deg F. on the 21st eclipsing the old record of 35 deg F. set in 1908.  A record low maximum temperature was seen in Bakersfield on the 22nd with the mercury only reaching 34 deg F. and only 35 deg F. for Fresno.  Subsequently a record low temperature was tied in Bakersfield on the morning of the 23rd with a 19 deg F. reading.  This freeze was eerily reminiscent of a similar event during the same time period in December of 1990.

322547	1998-04-16	HAIL	KY	0	0	5.1e+08	0	A large classic supercell thunderstorm moved from northern Logan county through central parts of Warren, Barren and Metcalfe counties and then into western Adair county. A swath of large hail accompanied the storm across Logan and Warren counties and correlated well with maximum KLVX WSR-88D composite reflectivities. Many places along the route of the storm reported baseball size hail. Bowling Green was particularly devastated by the storm with incredible damage to all area car lots, all police cars, homes and Western Kentucky University. Every car dealership and rent-a-car lot had all of their cars totaled. In all, 8,300 homes, 900 mobile homes, 4,000 vehicles, 37 businesses, and 14 apartments sustained major damage. Minor damage was reported to 1,300 homes, 6,000 vehicles, 42 businesses and 4 churches. Most of this damage was attributed to the hail as opposed to the F1 tornado that passed just to the south of Bolwing Green. In fact the total damage attributed to hail was estimated at at least 510 million dollars. Several people also received minor injuries from being struck by the hail.  
323957	1998-01-05	ICE STORM	ME	1	0	3.04e+08	0	M81PH A severe ICE STORM hit sections of central and southern Maine from January 5 through January 9.  One of the hardest hit areas stretched from Bridgton to Lewiston to Augusta to Waterville where ice accreted several inches thick on trees, power lines, and other exposed surfaces causing almost everyone in those areas to lose electrical service.   Statewide, the storm knocked out power to about 365,000 customers, an estimated 840,000 people or about 70 percent of the state's population of 1.2 million people.  About one third of those that lost power were without electricity for more than a week.  For some, the electricity was off for up to 3 weeks.  During this time, residents and those involved with the restoration efforts had to contend with snow, additional freezing rain, rain, slippery roads, falling ice and other debris, sub-zero temperatures, strong winds, and dangerous wind chills.  For many homes, the lack of electrical power also meant no heat, no running water, no means for cooking food.   In Maine, the storm caused an estimated 300 million dollars in damages (as of late April) with this estimate continuing to climb as cleanup efforts continue.  Debris cleanup from the storm was expected to last into the summer.  Utilities had to replace over 3200 snapped utility poles, over 1.2 million feet of wire/cable, more than 1600 crossarms, and more than 2100 transformers.   A major transmission line that serviced Downeast Maine was flattened by the storm as the weight of the ice snapped all the poles in an eight-mile section of line.  A total of 7 radio or communications towers were felled by the ice.  The storm damaged an estimated $300 million worth of timber with after harvest losses estimated to be $28 million.  Numerous disaster shelters were set up throughout the affected areas.  Following the storm, all counties in Maine were declared federal disaster areas by the President. The storm started as intermittent light freezing rain freezing drizzle during the early morning hours of Monday, January 5th and continued through the day Wednesday, January 7th.  While temperatures warmed to above freezing in some parts of southern Maine during this period, areas of central interior Maine remained below freezing.  By Wednesday morning, areas of central interior Maine were reporting generally 1/8 to 1/4 inch of ice accretion with some localized areas with up to 1/2 inch of ice accretion.  Northern Maine had light snow during this period. Steadier and heavier freezing rain and freezing drizzle developed over portions of central and southern Maine during Wednesday afternoon and evening, January 7, 1998 and continued through Friday, January 9th, as a quasistationary front remained south of the state.  To the north of the front, cold air remained entrenched near the ground as warm moist air moved northward from the mid-Atlantic states over the wedge of colder air.  Severe icing occurred over most of southern and central Maine. By Saturday morning, January 10, the precipitation had ended over Maine with 1 to 3 inches of ice accretion to wires, poles, branches, etc., over most of central and southern Maine.  Accretions to communication towers were even greater.  A 1/2 inch guy wire in the Bar Harbor area was reported to be encased in ice 9-inches in diameter .  This ice not only provided additional  weight to the objects it coated, it also provided additional support.  As temperatures warmed Saturday in southern areas, this additional support melted away causing numerous trees and branches, and at least 4 radio or communication towers to fall.  Falling ice also created additional problems and was an extreme hazard to anyone venturing outside.  The town of Gray declared a state-of-emergency Saturday morning to keep residents from venturing out of shelters , due to the extreme hazard.  These hazards continued in southern and central areas Sunday, particularly in areas that failed to get above freezing during the day Saturday.  In central part of the state, particularly in shaded areas, the threat from falling ice and debris persisted considerably longer. In parts northern Maine, more than two feet of snow during the week with as much as 6 to 10 inches of sleet reported in some parts of north central Maine. Within the state, 5 deaths were attributed to the storm, although most occurred in the aftermath of the storm.  Two men died in separate incidents from carbon monoxide poisoning from inadequately ventilated generators.  Carbon monoxide poisoning reached epidemic proportions statewide with between 300 and 400 people treated at area hospitals, possibly the largest outbreak of carbon monoxide poisoning ever in the nation.   One man was killed when he was struck by a tree while cleaning up debris shortly after the storm.  One elderly man died of hypothermia after falling down a flight of stairs in his dark, unheated home.  In addition, one man was crushed when the roof over a gas station island collapsed under the weight of snow and ice several weeks after the storm.  In addition, the weight of the ice/snow from this and subsequent storms caused numerous roofs and buildings to collapse, primarily in central and eastern Maine. Long-term effects from the ice storm are expected to persist for many years.  Tree damage was extensive and will affect those people and companies that depend on trees for quite a few years.  In some areas, most of the maple trees used for syrup were severely damaged.  For many municipalities, debris cleanup will last well into the summer.  The debris will create an increase in the forest fire danger over the next several years and has blocked many fire access roads and trails.   Some recreational hiking trails remain closed due to debris.  Additionally, many, many tree limbs were left dangling by the ice storm and many trees were left partially fallen  These "widow makers" will pose a significant threat to anyone who works, walks, or drives through wooded areas over the next several years.           
323829	1998-08-01	DROUGHT	LA	0	0	0	137900000	The drought of 1998 continued in the month of August across southwest and central Louisiana. Between four and five inches of rain fell in the entire month of August across this region, which was actually the most in a month since April 1998.  Total dollar figure losses by southwest and central Louisiana farmers was nearly $138,000,000. The hardest hit parishes were Avoyelles and St. Landry Parishes, where over $55,000,000 was lost.  By product, the worst loss was soybeans, with an estimated $40,000,000 lost, followed by sugarcane at $25,000,000, and corn grain at $24,000,000. These statistics were tabulated by the Agricultural Center at Louisiana State University.

327468	1998-09-27	HURRICANE	MS	0	0	6.02e+08	0	Hurricane Georges, a strong Category 2 hurricane moved slowly northwest across the Gulf of Mexico  toward southeast Louisiana and coastal Mississippi on the September 25 and September 26. As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27, it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast just to the east of Biloxi, MS at 0400 CST on September 28. The hurricane moved only slowly north during the morning hours, at times becoming nearly stationary. The hurricane finally was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1500CST on September 28 when it was located north of Biloxi. The tropical storm then moved very slowly eastward into southern Alabama on September 29.  The greatest affect from the hurricane occurred over Jackson County which experienced the intense eastern portion of the hurricanes eyewall and highest storm surge. Due to the slow forward speed of the hurricane very heavy rainfall occurred over eastern Harrison County and Jackson County leading to record flooding on streams and rivers. The barrier islands in the Mississippi Sound were also heavily damaged by wind and storm surge. A new three quarter mile cut developed in the east portion of Ship Island.  Total insured property damage in Mississippi was estimated at near 310 million dollars by insurance industry sources. When unisured losses and public property damage considered, total damages in Mississippi will likely approach $620 million. Hancock County - Wind damage in Hancock County was mostly confined to large tree limbs snapped off, trees downed, and minor roof damage to houses and businesses, and damage to commercial signs. Storm surge was of minimal impact with the county remaining on the west side of the hurricane. Storm surge was 4 to 5 ft above normal with only minor coastal flooding and beach erosion occurring. Approximately 2,000 people were housed in public shelters. Harrison County - Moderate wind damage occurred throughout the parish. Many commercial signs were damaged or destroyed, large trees limbs and trees downed, and wind damaged roofs or houses and businesses. At the Gulfport Harbor, a wind gage recorded a maximum gust of 80 mph at 0415CST on September 28.  At approximately the same time period, a gust to 117 mph was recorded in Gulfport, one mile north of the beach.  Storm surge flooding was generally 6 to 7 feet above normal across the coast. Storm surge flooding crossed US Highway 90 in several locations, but storm surge flooding to property was not considered major. A maximum stage of  8.1 ft was recorded at the Gulfport Harbor. Due to the slow movement of the hurricane, heavy rain occurred over the east portion of the county and adjacent areas. Significant river flooding occurred on the Biloxi and Tchoutacabouffa Rivers on the September 28 and September 29.  Wortham, on the Biloxi River reached its second highest stage of record with a reading of 25.47 ft on September 29.   Many county residents evacuated low lying areas in advance of the hurricane with approximately 3700 seeking refuge in public evacuation shelters within the county.  Jackson County - Jackson County bore the brunt of Hurricane Georges with the area experiencing the strong right front quadrant of the hurricane's circulation. A storm surge of 8 to 11 feet caused storm surge flooding along low lying coastal areas. This was the greatest storm surge flooding in Jackson County in nearly 30 years. In the east beach section of the Bellefontaine area, 23 of 27 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed by storm surge. Many businesses and industries located in low lying coastal areas were flooded causing considerable property damage and loss of revenue. The U.S. Navy facility at Pascagoula suffered $2.2 million in property damage, primarily roof and water damage.  Several unofficial anemometers recorded gusts between 85 and 100 mph in the Pascagoula area. Moderate wind damage was reported across the parish. Numerous commercial signs were destroyed, trees downed, roofs damaged, and power lines and poles downed.  Approximately 4600 people sought refuge in public hurricane evacuation shelters in Jackson County. Two shelters, one in Gautier and one in Pascagoula, suffered wind damage to the roof at the height of the storm.  Due to the slow forward speed of Hurricane Georges, widespread heavy rainfall occurred over Jackson County and over the watershed of the Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers. Rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was common over Jackson County. River flooding developed over much of the county by September 28. A record flood crest of 20.82 feet was established on Red Creek at Vestry. On the Escatawpa River, a record flood crest of 22.70 feet was established at Agricola.  Approximately 3,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas, primarily in the Escatawpa River basin, with hundreds of structures flooded in the county.   Pearl River County - Damage was mainly confined to downed tree limbs and trees, minor to moderate roof damage to homes and businesses, and power outages from downed power lines. Several secondary highways and roadways in the county were blocked by fallen trees. Storm total rainfall was fairly light with amounts of 2 to 4 inches common. About 200 people were sheltered in public hurricane evacuations shelters in the county.         
333681	1998-08-26	HURRICANE	NC	0	0	6400000	1.17e+08	Hurricane Bonnie, a minimal Catagory III Hurricane approached the coast of North Carolina on August 26th. The slow moving hurricane initially crossed Cape Fear during the late afternoon on the 26th, then pivoted northeast along the North Carolina coast during the evening. With part of the circulation center on land, the storm weakened to Catagory I storm in the early morning hours of the 27th before making landfall near the Onslow/Pender county line. The storm then continued to move slowly northeast at speeds of 10 mph or less. Bonnie was downgraded to a Tropical Storm during the afternoon of the 27th but later was reclassified as a Hurricane as she moved off Kitty Hawk late in the evening. Bonnie was a unique storm in that the strongest winds were not located around the center of circulation like a typical hurricane but encompassed a large area in the eastern semi-circle. The most damaging winds were contained in the precursor rain bands where localized downbursts produced siginficant damage...especially along the coast of Carteret county which appeared to sustain the most damage from the storm. The slow movement of the storm contributed to excessive rainfall amounts with totals of 7-10 inches common across eastern North Carolina. Since much of the region had experienced below normal rainfall during the  summer months,  the resulting flood was not as damaging as it could have been. The Southeast Cape Fear River in Duplin county had the most significant flooding with areas near Chinquapin reporting high water. Elsewhere flooding of poor drainage and low lying areas predominated. Coastal/Storm surge flooding  was not  as extensive as with Huuricanes Fran or Bertha but several locations did report significant problems. The hardest hit area was Belhaven where storm surge flooding along the Pungo River flooded 2/3rds of the homes in the area with water levels as high as 6 ft above normal. Other coastal flooding was reported in Manns Harbor and Stumpy Point in Dare county, Washington in Beaufort county, Near Hobucken in Pamlico county, Swansboro in Onslow county and along the south shore of the Albemarle sound in Washington and Tyrrell counties. Many docks, piers and bulkheads were damaged or destroyed by the storm. Along the Outer Banks, soundside flooding from the Pamlico Sound late on the 27th and early on the 28th produced water levels 4-6 feet above normal in Manteo on Roanoke Island and over portions of Hatteras Island where Route 12 was closed briefly due to high water. Storm surge at the beaches of Onslow and Carteret counties was generally 3-5 feet above normal with moderate beach erosion. North Topsail Beach lost most of the protective dunes constructed after the hurricanes of 1996. Tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef,  washed up on the shore of Bogue Banks. Wind damage was greatest along Bogue Banks where two hotels and one department store lost roofs. The Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers sustained significant damage losing large sections due to the combination of wind and rough surf. The hurricane also produced 7 confirmed tornadoes during the afternoon and evening of the 26th. The heavy rains and strong winds also led to significant crop damage with Onslow county reporting over 110 million dollars in damages. Several minor injuries but no loss of life were reported during the storm.
336988	1998-07-06	DROUGHT	OK	0	0	0	5e+08	 A devastating drought and heat wave affected southeastern Oklahoma farmers during the month of July.  At McAlester, the only rainfall during July was 0.19" on the first two days of the month.  The southeast Oklahoma climate division (which includes Choctaw, Pushmataha, Latimer and Le Flore Counties) received 50 percent of normal rainfall from May 1 through July 31.  By the end of July, southeast Oklahoma was classified by the Palmer Drought Index as being in the midst of a "severe drought", while east central Oklahoma was experiencing "moderate drought".  From a historical perspective, the period from June 1-July 31 was the third driest on record in southeast Oklahoma, while the period from April 1-July 31 was the fourth driest on record in east central Oklahoma.   When combined with 100+ degree temperatures on 24 out of 31 days during the month (at McAlester) and relative humidities under 25 percent on many afternoons, crops stood little chance of survival.  The Oklahoma Agriculture Secretary estimated crop damage throughout Oklahoma at $2 billion, of which $500 million might have taken place in southeast and east central Oklahoma.  The President declared the counties listed here as a drought disaster area, nine of sixty-six counties throughout southern and central Oklahoma receiving this designation. For more information on the heat wave, please refer to the Excessive Heat entry in eastern Oklahoma's July Storm Data.

343894	1998-09-07	TROPICAL STORM	TX	3	0	287180000	0	Synoptic Situation... On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center. Tides.... Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels.  On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels.  Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed. Winds and Pressure.. Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.   The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11. Rainfall... Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning.  River and Bayou Flooding... September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.   By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event. In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding. Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility. The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways. Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated.  Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County. Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas. Impact and Damage... Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous.  There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.   Summary... Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.

Deep moisture was in place across South Central Texas as the two systems approached, being fed at the mid and upper levels by two nearly stationary hurricanes, Madeline near the tip of Baja Mexico, and Lester, anchored just off Acapulco, Mexico, and in the low levels by a strong flow from the Gulf of Mexico.  A very moisture-rich environment was in place across South Central Texas as the event developed.  Near 3 am CST, with the cold front still west of San Angelo, scattered showers and thunderstorms began to break out  over Bexar County beneath the mid and upper level moisture plume.  They quickly became widespread as a low level rain-cooled boundary formed along the south and east edge of the county.  It was upon this boundary that subsequent showers and thunderstorms continued to form.  By 6 am CST, rainfall of up to 4 inches had been reported in Western Bexar County, with amounts approaching 4 inches in Western Comal County.  By 8 am CST that morning, heavy rain continued over Bexar County, and had spread northward across Comal County into Hays, Travis and Williamson Counties.  Amounts at this time were approaching 8 inches in Bexar and Comal Counties and 4 inches in Hays and Travis Counties.  The heavy rain continued through the morning period.   Shortly before noon on Saturday, heavy rain began to spread eastward into Guadalupe, Caldwell, Bastrop and Lee Counties.  Through the mid afternoon, moderate to heavy rain continued between San Antonio and Austin, with widespread heavy rain over Comal, Hays, Caldwell, Guadalupe and Gonzales Counties.  By 5 pm CST, the strongest low level flow had also shifted eastward, focusing the heaviest rainfall through the evening period over the area from LaGrange to Gonzales to Karnes City to Cuero and Hallettsville.  By midnight, heavy rain had exited the Cuero-Hallettsville area, and moderate rain had again broken out over Bexar and Comal Counties.  The activity spread westward through the early morning hours on Sunday to Hondo and Uvalde and northwestward into the Hill Country.  At the same time, moderate to heavy rain also redeveloped along and north of a line from San Antonio to Gonzales to LaGrange.  By late Sunday morning, the cold front moved through South Central Texas, and had slowed and stalled as it approached the Lower Texas Coast.  Spotty heavy rainfall continued in the wake of the front between San Antonio, Burnet and Bastrop as another weak upper level disturbance in the southwesterly flow aloft approached.  Heavy rain also developed along the front, just north of Laredo and along the coastal plains from Corpus Christi to Victoria.  Even though rainfall amounts in the San Antonio to New Braunfels to San Marcos to Austin corridor were generally below 2 inches on Sunday, soils remained saturated from the previous day's deluge and periods of flash flooding were reported through the mid morning. By Sunday afternoon, rain had diminished in the San Antonio to Austin corridor, while clouds, rain and frequent showers continued east of the area.  Thereafter, rainfall was generally along and east of a LaGrange-Gonzales-Karnes City line, where an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain fell on Sunday and 2 to 4 inches fell on Monday.  Only scattered light rain was reported on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 20th and 21st of October. All rivers, creeks and streams along and east of a San Antonio to Austin line remained at or above flood stage from Saturday, October 17th through Sunday, October 18th, with a majority continuing to flood through Monday, October 19th.  On Tuesday, October 20th and Wednesday, October 21st,flooding was confined to rivers, streams and creeks along and east of a LaGrange-Gonzales-Karnes City line.   This event broke rainfall records across South Central Texas, producing 18 floods of record in South Central Texas streams.  October became the wettest of any month in climate records for San Antonio since 1885.  October 17th became the wettest day and wettest 24-hour period in San Antonio climatic records, nearly doubling both previous records. Rivers across the area reached or exceeded record stage heights, resulting in widespread flooding in the flood plains of streams, creeks and rivers. Rainfall amounts on October 17 and 18th from northern Bexar County to southeast Kendall County, most of Comal County and southern Hays County ranged from 15 to 22 inches.  Damage and destruction to livestock and agriculture, roads and bridges and both public and property and buildings significantly exceeded that of previous flooding.  Thousands to tens of thousands of livestock were killed, as nearly 3000 homes were destroyed and another 8000 or so homes were damaged.  Nearly 1000 mobile homes were destroyed and another 3000 were damaged. Twenty-five people drowned as a direct result of the flooding in October in South Central Texas.  All nine deaths in Bexar County on Saturday, as well as the two on Sunday, were associated with driving vehicles into flooded waters.  Four of the six Caldwell County deaths, two of the three Guadalupe County deaths, and all of the four deaths in Comal, Travis and Uvalde County were associated with vehicles as well.  Two deaths in Caldwell County and one in Guadalupe County occurred as residents were swept by flood waters from their homes.  In addition, one man in Comal County suffered a heart attack and died waiting to be rescued and another died of a heart attack while being rescued.  A third man in Guadalupe County accidently touched a live wire while in his boat.  He was severely shocked and died from drowning as a result of the shock.

344102	1998-10-17	FLOOD	TX	0	550	6.6e+07	230000	Flooding along the San Antonio River, Cibolo Creek and Geronimo Creek In Bexar County, the San Antonio River begins just below Olmos Dam where it merges with spring flow.   Two new flood tunnels on the San Antonio River and Apache Creek respectively saved downtown San Antonio and homes and businesses below Brackenridge Golf Course to the old Lone Star Brewery from very serious flooding. At Loop 410 in San Antonio, the San Antonio River crested at 36.2 feet, where flood stage is 20 feet.  Several homes just below Loop 410 had 10 feet of water over the slabs.  At Elmendorf, the San Antonio crested at 64.6 feet, with flood stage at 35 feet.  Flow escaped out of the deep canyon of the channel and flowed over the prevailing very flat flood plain, severely flooding homes.  In Wilson County at Floresville, the San Antonio flooded several houses, but residential flooding was not nearly as severe as other areas. In Karnes County near Falls City, the gauge flooded early in the event as the San Antonio flooded five homes in the southwest section of the city. In Bexar County, Cibolo Creek at Selma was gauged at 22' and rising, with flood stage at 17 feet.  At Schertz, the crest was well above the 26 foot crest of June 22, 1997.  Here the flood stage is at 13 feet.  This crest in excess of 30 feet put over 17 feet of water above the tops of mobile homes.  Mobile homes were floating like boats, and moved downstream until they hit something permanent..   Farther up on the right flood plain, another community of mobile homes, permanent homes, and RVs were completely destroyed, moving downstream until they encountered something.  Many homes above the city park, upstream, left bank from the Highway 78 bridge flooded.  The railroad bridge trestle had water just to the tracks.  Downstream, in Wilson County, near Lavernia, Cibolo Creek produced a sheet flow that surged over the flood plain in an area well over a mile wide and up to six feet deep.  Many homes were flooded in this area.   Lavernia volunteer firemen performed rescues in fire trucks where they could, then commandeered high powered boats.   The boats were destroyed in the rescue attempts.   Several businesses in Lavernia were flooded.   At one point, a fire truck stalled in Lavernia for hours until the firemen themselves could be rescued. Downstream, below Sutherland Springs, Highway 87 was flooded with several feet of water for miles.   Debris formed dams in the trees beside the highway as a mute testimony to remnants of houses, boats, cars, and items that flowed across the road.  At Falls City in Karnes County, the Cibolo Creek crested at 39.9 feet, where flood stage is 20 feet.  It accounted for a very heavy loss of livestock. Geronimo Creek in Guadalupe County put several feet of water into homes in Geronimo, just east of Highway 123 below the bridge. In Seguin, Geronimo Creek crested near 26 feet, below Highway 90A, flooding many homes severely.   The lowest home about 1/4 mile below Highway 90A, has a slab at 15 gauge height, and had water on the roof.   Flow was over the Highway 90A bridge, and estimated near 26 feet.   
344117	1998-10-17	FLOOD	TX	0	750	2.68e+08	1550000	Flooding along the Guadalupe River The Guadalupe River at New Braunfels crested at 35.1 feet, with flood stage at 7 feet.  This was over three feet higher than the disastrous flood of May 12, 1972.   Homes were destroyed, moved downstream, or severely damaged from just below Sattler, near the Bear Creek confluence, across the remainder of the county.  Homes along the entire reach were flooded well away from the channel, in areas that never flooded before.  Along River Road, numerous autos, RVs, and homes  were strewn along the flood plain.  Recreational camps and outfitters headquarters buildings were destroyed.  Homes near Common Street in New Braunfels had slabs as low as 12.5 feet.   These homes had 23 feet of torrential flow over the slabs.   At the New Braunfels gauge below the Comal River confluence just above IH 35, the Guadalupe crested at 39.3 feet, again some three feet above the disastrous flood of May 12, 1972.   Water seeped into the Pepperell Mills plant.   A large apartment complex left bank just downstream had flow through the windows of the lowest floors. Water was within five feet of the IH 35 bridge bottom.   Below IH 35, fine two story homes were destroyed, or severely damaged.  Several RV trailers were washed from an RV park below the IH 35 bridge.   As the Guadalupe continued southward into Guadalupe County, RVs and permanent homes on the banks were flooded all the way down Lake Dunlap and along Lake McQueeny, where the Las Brisas subdivision had very expensive, two story homes severely damaged.   Treasure Island was almost completely under water, as again, nearly all the very expensive homes were flooded with several feet of water.   The flooding was comprehensive over the entire flood plain below Sattler. In Seguin, some homes washed downstream in the right flood plain below Lake Placid.   Also, as in the May 12, 1972 flood, some washed downstream in the Glen Cove subdivision. In Gonzales, the Guadalupe crested at 51.7 feet, where flood stage is 31 feet.  Flow was five feet over the sills of the windows of the old GBRA power plant.   Flooding was several miles wide between Gonzales and the Guadalupe/San Marcos Rivers confluence.   The city park was inundated with tens of feet of water in lower sections.  Flow backed up Tinsley Creek and flooded homes miles into Gonzales. The most extensive flooding along the Guadalupe River took place in DeWitt County.  One DeWitt County rancher lost three hundred cattle, and another near 200.   Total livestock losses in the flood probably exceeded well over ten thousand head. At Cuero, the Guadalupe crested at 49.8 feet, with flood stage at 20 feet.  The flooding was devastating, with homes two miles east of the channel washed downstream along the west edge of the downtown area.   Several homes were washed across Highway 87.   One home washed over Highway 87, but was stopped as it smashed into a more permanent commercial building, and came to rest in the eastbound (downstream) lane of Highway 87.   There were many city blocks where homes were washing downstream, reflecting the deep flow and its velocity. The flooding did not get into the downtown section, but just to the west edge.  A narrow ridge between the channel and downtown appeared to be out of the water.   The Guadalupe was reported to be between four and five miles wide just south of Cuero.  At Thomaston, the Guadalupe flooded the county road over a mile away from the normal river channel. Undoubtedly, well over a hundred homes were flooded, with many going downstream.   Flow was near 20 feet over the lowest slabs of the River Haven, Cypress Valley, and River Oaks subdivisions.
344413	1998-12-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	4.5e+08	Near-average precipitation returned to the South Plains area in December.  However, the effects of this year's drought became better understood after year-end agricultural reports were completed.  These reports, compiled by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service at Texas A&M University, indicated that total crop damage may have been about $450 million due to the drought across the Texas South Plains area in 1998.  This figure is based on the total cash value of all crops in 1998, compared to the average of the same figure from 1996 and 1997. Cotton is the dominant crop in this region, and not surprisingly, accounted for roughly 75% ( $330 million) of the losses this year.  Significant losses were also suffered in the corn ($58 million), wheat ($35 million), sorghum ($18 million), and soybean ($18 million) crops.

350581	1999-04-10	EXTREME COLD	CA	0	0	0	131010000	Unseasonably cool air led to strong radiational cooling conditions and minor frost episodes on the mornings of April 1st (unofficial report of 29 deg F.), 2nd, and the coolest conditions of these three days occurred on the morning of Easter Sunday, the 4th, in the Central and Southern San Joaquin Valley.  The 3 days early in the month were followed by another relatively cold morning on the 10th.  While not all areas dropped to less than freezing, several areas had temperatures in the 28 to 32 degree range for 4 hours, with pockets dropping unofficially as low as 25 deg F. on the west side in Kings and Fresno Counties.  Fresno dropped to 33F on the 4th which broke the old record of 35 set in 1901...and dropped to 34F on the 10th.  On the other hand, Bakersfield's lowest temperature was 33F on the 10th, with a 35F low on the 4th.  In Kings County, Hanford dropped to 33F on the 4th, and 34F on the 10th.  This time of year deciduous trees, vineyards, and vegetable crops are quite vulnerable to temperatures less than 30 degrees for any length of time. While damage losses at individual locations varied from only 30 to 60%, the amount of agricultural crop value for the San Joaquin Valley led to a substantial damage figure.  All this on the heels of the disastrous December 1998 Freeze (see December Storm-of-the-Month).  Damage due to freezing was assessed at Merced $12.0M, Madera $8.5M, and Fresno $88.75M for the Central Valley; and Kings $12.76M and Tulare $9.0M for the Southern San Joaquin Valley.
353090	1999-10-14	HURRICANE	FL	0	4	2.62e+08	3.38e+08	After lingering as a broad area of low pressure in the western Caribbean Sea for four days, a tropical depression formed just after midnight EDT on October 13 and became tropical storm Irene in the northwest Caribbean Sea later that morning.  Irene moved north across western Cuba on October 14 and strengthened to hurricane intensity early on October 15 in the Straits of Florida.  It then made its first landfall in south Florida in the lower Florida Keys around 9 AM EDT, October 15.  After crossing Florida Bay the center of Irene made landfall on the peninsula near Cape Sable around 4 PM EDT, October 15 as a Category One intensity hurricane.  It moved northeast across central Miami-Dade and Broward counties before exiting into the Atlantic just after midnight EDT on October 16 near Jupiter in northeast Palm Beach County. Heavy rains and sustained winds of tropical storm force caused widespread flooding and power outages in the metropolitan areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.  The effects were similar, although somewhat more widespread, than those experienced in tropical storm Gordon in November 1994 and were reminiscent of the wet hurricanes in the 1930s and 1940s. Rainfall totals in southeast Florida ranged from 6 to 17 inches with many areas getting 10 to 15 inches.  The greatest reliable amount reported was 17.45 inches at Boynton Beach.  The highest sustained wind over land was 60 mph at Miami Beach with many readings from 40 to 55 mph.  Fowey Rocks Light reported sustained winds of 66 mph while the Miami NWS doppler radar estimated areas of sustained hurricane force winds in the Atlantic Ocean just off the southeast Florida coast.  Among the highest recorded gusts were readings of 93 mph near Belle Glade, 85 mph at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 84 mph at Fowey Rocks Light, 74 mph at Turkey Point nuclear power plant and 70 mph at Miami International Airport.  The lowest barometric pressure on the south Florida peninsula was 989.9 mb at Opa Locka Airport.  Storm surge and beach erosion were minimal. Four tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach counties, injuring 3 persons.  Several other areas of localized wind damage were reported, especially near the southeast shore of Lake Okeechobee, and were likely attributable to convective downbursts. There were no direct deaths from Irene, but eight persons died in the aftermath.  Five persons were electrocuted by downed power lines, including three persons from one family.  Three other persons drowned in vehicle-related accidents.  Damage in southeast Florida, mainly from flooding is estimated near $600 million which includes $335 million in agricultural losses.  An estimated 700,000 customers lost electricity.  Flooding in a few residential areas lasted for a week displacing several hundred persons and isolating thousands more. Other long-term ecological repercussions may be experienced from the flooding rains such as the effects of high water on Everglade's hammocks, and the effects of excessive fresh-water runoff on estuaries.

356385	1999-07-20	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	0	109920000	The most intense hot and dry weather to affect Iowa in the last four years occurred during the last half of July.  A large sub-tropical ridge of high pressure developed over the central U.S. as the drought that was widespread over the southern and eastern U.S. expanded northwest.  Temperatures warmed into the mid to upper 90s, and occasionally over 100 degrees, for a 10 day period.  Overnight low temperatures were in the mid to upper 70s for the most part.  It was fortunate for the crops in the state that the dew point temperatures during the heat were unusually high.  Dew point temperatures held in the mid 70s to low 80s during much of the period of hot weather.  Rainfall was very scattered with most of it falling to the north of the affected area.  Though the entire state was affected by the hot and dry conditions, most of the damage occurred over the south third of the state.  The unfortunate thing was that the heat occurred during the critical pollination period.  Typically, temperatures in excess of 95 degrees hinder the pollination process.  This was the case this year with many reports of partial ear fill being reported.  Losses over the south third of the state were near 20%.  Total losses due to the heat were in the area of $110,000,000 in lost production.  Fortunately for Iowa, there were no deaths directly attributed to the hot and dry conditions, though there were several occurrences that the heat may have played a role.
356742	1999-05-03	TORNADO	KS	6	150	1.4e+08	0	The same tornado that initially touched down 4 miles north of Wellington in Central Sumner County, SKYWARN reports indicate the tornado crossed the Sumner/Sedgwick County line at 1930, 1 mile west of Peck. Moving northeast at 30 kts, the tornado hit Haysville at 1935, destroying a subdivision just southwest of the South Seneca-South 87th Street intersection where the first 2 fatalities occurred in a mobile home park when a woman and her grandson were killed while running for shelter. (A 6th fatality resulted when an elderly man died from his injuries at a Wichita hospital on May 23rd.) The tornado then moved north along South Seneca Avenue, entering the Haysville Central Business District at 1938. The 3rd fatality occurred at this point when an elderly man was killed in a mobile home at South 75th Street. At the South Seneca/South 71st Street intersection, most of the businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed. Damage summary for Haysville (damaged or destroyed): 150 homes, 27 businesses, 3 churches, 1 library, 4 historic buildings and 1 lodge.  The tornado entered South Wichita at 1943 when it crossed South 55th Street. The tornado then veered slightly toward the northwest. At South 47th Street it reassumed a northeast track. Crossing MacArthur Avenue, the tornado leveled the Lakeshore and Pacesetter mobile home parks located just northeast of the South Seneca/MacArthur intersection where the 4th and 5th fatalities occurred, one at each mobile home park. At 1945, the tornado crossed the East Harry Street interchange on I-135 and continued to move northeast, lifting in the College Hill District in Northeast Wichita. Along this entire track, the tornado left a path of destruction 14 miles long and 1/4 to 1/2 mile wide. Damage summary for Sedgwick County: 8,480 buildings (all types) damaged or destroyed. Of these, 2,456 were at least 50% destroyed and 1,109 totally destroyed.   M27MH, F43OU, M1OU, M83MH, M68MH, M78MH 
358688	1999-09-01	DROUGHT	KY	0	0	0	1.54e+08	The severe summer drought took a major toll on crops and plants across West Kentucky. Rainfall at Paducah for the three-month period from July through September was about an inch and a half. This compares to a 3-month average of around 10 inches. Paducah received 0.66 inches in September, which was 3 inches below normal. The soybean crop sustained the greatest monetary losses, estimated near 70 million dollars. This was followed by tobacco losses near 50 million, and corn near 35 million. Total crop losses in western Kentucky were near 155 million dollars, which prompted an agricultural disaster declaration by the state and federal governments. The root systems of many shrubs and young trees were damaged by the drought. Some shrubs and shallow-rooted trees, such as dogwood and redbud trees, died during the summer. The unirrigated pumpkin crop was nearly a total loss. The fire danger reached extreme levels at times. A few of the largest fires reached 500 to 1000 acres in size. The largest fire occurred east of Central City in Muhlenberg County late in the month. This fire grew to almost 1000 acres, prompting the closure of the Western Kentucky Parkway for several hours. Another large fire, estimated around 500 acres, occurred in Hickman County early in the month. This fire, which may have been sparked by a passing train, burned quite a few corn and soybean fields. Finally, a 100-acre cornfield fire near Henderson closed the Pennyrile Parkway for about an hour and forced the brief evacuation of a nursing home. Burning bans were imposed in virtually all western Kentucky counties, including a campfire ban in the Land Between The Lakes National Recreation Area. The Kentucky Division of Water declared a Water Shortage Warning for the Pennyrile area, which includes the Owensboro and Hopkinsville areas. However, no mandatory water conservation measures were imposed. A secondary effect of the drought was premature leaf-drop, which reduced the brilliance of the fall colors. River levels on the Ohio River became unsafe for navigation in places. Fully loaded barges could not safely navigate the river, so tonnage was reduced by 10 to 20 percent.          
365168	1999-09-16	FLASH FLOOD	NJ	2	100	3.58e+08	0	M58PH, F85PH Hurricane Floyd battered New Jersey (especially the central and northern thirds) on September 16th and brought with it torrential and in some areas, unprecedented and record breaking rains and damaging winds.  The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th. A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance.  Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.    Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.    Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.         Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough. Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th. On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships.  In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars. In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.     Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike.

366637	1999-09-14	HURRICANE	NC	13	0	410620000	413600000	Hurricane Floyd caused the largest peace time evacuation in the nations history.  He also caused massive record flooding across inland sections of eastern North Carolina.  At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century. Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.   Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area. Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.   Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier. Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out. Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area. Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.  Unofficially the flooding from Hurricane Floyd has been compared to a 500 year flood.  At least 13 fatalities have been reported during the event in the 15 county warning area.  Unfortunately, a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the victims not driven through flooded roadways.  As with most hurricanes, inland flooded is now responsible for the largest percentage of  fatalities.  M55BO, M76VE, M63IW, M42VE, M70VE, M65IW, M54IW, M2IW, M86PH, M19IW, M26VE, M27VE, M43VE
366653	1999-09-15	HURRICANE	NC	0	0	3e+09	5e+08	Hurricane Floyd produced more human misery and environmental impact in North Carolina  than any  disaster in memory. The 15-20 inches of rain that fell across the eastern half of the  state caused every  river and stream to flood.  Many rivers set new flood records. Whole communities were underwater  for days, even weeks in some areas.   Thousand's of homes were lost.  Crop damage was extensive.  The infrastructure of the eastern counties, mainly   roads, bridges, water plants, etc., was heavily damaged.   By the end of 1999, $1.5 billion had already been spent, with estimates that  the cost would  reach  $3-4 billion.  The counties within the Raleigh county  warning area probably sustained more than half  of  the state total. Even worse, was the loss of life, manly due to flooding. Many Carolinians did not  heed  the call  to evacuate and many more drove into flooded streams and rivers.  In  the central part of the state, 21 people lost  their lives.   Also,  the loss of livestock was significant, mainly swine and poultry.  Floyd will indeed go down  in the history books. 
366668	1999-09-15	HURRICANE	NC	0	0	1.09e+08	4e+06	Hurricane Floyd, with wind gusts around 90 mph caused widespread downed trees and power outages. In Brunswick County, power was out to 95% of the county. The wind did major damage to the roof of Brunswick Community Hospital. Storm surge was 7 to 9 feet on the east side of the county and 3 to 6 feet further west. Ocean Crest Pier, Long Beach Pier and Sunset Beach Pier were hard hit. Ocean overwash was worst at Oak Island, where 4 miles with 100 oceanfront homes sustained $23 million damage. Holden Beach sustained $8.8 million damage, where 46 homes were condemned, many due to exposed septic tanks. Ocean Isle Beach suffered $6 million damage, where 2 homes were knocked off foundations and 500 feet of roadway was lost, with 28 homes declared unsafe. Sunset Beach had $1.25 million damage and lost half its dune and a road, isolating 75 homes. However, the heavy rains which accumulated around 20 inches caused the worst flooding in history. High water closed most roads, including US17, isolating many areas. A dam broke at Boiling Springs Lakes, inundating the area. In New Hanover County,  housing losses were near $25 million - 8 homes were destroyed and more than 200 sustained major damage. Ocean storm surge was 9 to 10 feet, inundating barrier islands and causing extensive dune erosion. Record rainfall distinguished Floyd - the most rain ever in 24 hours at ILM airport (14.84") and a storm total 19.06", causing widespread flooding. In Pender County, a 7 to 9  foot storm surge Beach damaged the barrier islands, eroding half the dune. However it was record rainfall with ensuing ponding and flooding of rivers that caused the most serious damage. The Northeast Cape Fear had the worst flood of the century, while that Black River flood was the worst since 1945. Largely due to flooding, more than 1000 homes suffered major damage and 200 more were condemned. More than 3000 hogs, 90,000 turkeys, and 200 cows were lost due to drowning. Animal waste and septic tanks added pollution to the flooding. Two human fatalities occurred as motorists drove into flooded parts of highways. In Columbus and Bladen Counties, wind gusts were near 75 mph in the eastern parts of the counties, downing trees and power lines. More than 15 inches of rain caused widespread flooding.   In Robeson Hurricane Floyd caused wind gusts near 70 mph in eastern Robeson County, downing trees and power lines. Rainfall around 10 inches caused widespread flooding.   
368021	1999-09-01	DROUGHT	OH	0	0	0	2e+08	Drought conditions continued across most of northern Ohio during September.  Widespread heavy rain occurred on the 29th but did little to help crop conditions.  For the month, only 1.63 inches of rain fell in Mansfield making it the 9th driest September on record.  Of the 1.63 inches, 1.14 inches fell on the 29th.  Even with an inch of rain on the 29th, both Toledo and Cleveland finished with below two inches of rain for the month.  Losses from reduced crop yields are estimated at $200 million for northern Ohio alone.
368820	1999-05-03	TORNADO	OK	11	293	4.5e+08	0	Tornado A9 (Cleveland County portion). See summary at end of May 3rd storm reports.   M26PH, M24PH, F94PH, M33PH, F30PH, M28PH, F89PH, F4PH, F36PH, M36PH, F26OU A record outbreak of tornadoes struck Oklahoma from late afternoon of May 3, 1999, through early morning of May 4, 1999. To date, 58 tornadoes have been recorded across portions of western and central Oklahoma. Additional tornadoes were reported across eastern Oklahoma from late evening of May 3rd through the early morning of May 4th, and are listed under the eastern Oklahoma portion of Storm Data, provided by the National Weather Service Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. All direct fatalities (40) and all direct injuries (675) occurred in the Norman National Weather Service warning area. The most notable tornado was rated F5 and formed over Grady County near Amber and tracked northeast for 37 miles eventually into the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Bridge Creek, Oklahoma City, Moore, Del City, and Midwest City suffered tremendous damage. Thirty-six direct fatalities and 583 direct injuries were recorded. There were many other significant tornadoes as well, including F4 tornadoes in Kingfisher and Logan Counties, and F3 tornadoes in Caddo, Grady, Kingfisher, Logan, and Lincoln Counties. Due to the magnitude of the tornado outbreak, and for easier reference, each tornado has received its own identification. There were 8 tornadic producing thunderstorms, called supercells, and most of them spawned numerous tornadoes, one after another. Occasionally, these thunderstorms spawned tornadoes at the same time. The first tornado producing thunderstorm of the day was labeled storm A, while the last tornado producing thunderstorm of the day was labeled storm I. Tornadoes produced by the same supercell thunderstorm have the same letter and were then numbered chronologically.  For example, the 3rd tornado produced by storm B was labeled B3.    Storm A produced 14 tornadoes over a period of about 7 hours and was eventually responsible for the F5 tornado that struck Bridge Creek, Oklahoma City and Moore. The 1st tornado of the outbreak, A1, touched down on US 62, 2 miles north of Interstate 44 in Comanche County at 1641 CST. No damage is believed to have occurred (F0). The 2nd tornado, A2, formed approximately 3 miles west of Elgin in Comanche County. Several witnesses confirmed this tornado, however no damage was observed (F0). The 3rd tornado, A3, touched down in a rural area 3 miles east of Apache in Caddo County. As the tornado moved northward to near Anadarko, one house was destroyed near the town of Stecker, with its roof ripped off and several walls knocked down (F3). Three person inside the house were injured. Several witnesses reported the 4th tornado, A4, 3 miles northwest of Cyril in Caddo County just west of SH 8. No damage was reported (F0). The 5th tornado, A5, formed 2 miles south of Anadarko in Caddo County. Two witnesses reported the tornado to be brief, and no damage was observed (F0).  The 6th tornado, A6, developed about 3 miles north-northeast of Cement near the Caddo/Grady County border, and quickly intensified to a strong tornado with associated damage rated at the high end of the F3 scale. The tornado tracked northeast for 9 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles west-northwest of downtown Chickasha. Two homes had just a few interior walls standing (F3), one located near US 62 on the northwest side of Chickasha, and several wooden high tension power lines were downed. Several persons were injured south of Verden near the Caddo/Grady County border. The 7th tornado, A7, has been referred to as a satellite tornado, and rotated around A6 for a short period of time, 5 miles west of Chickasha in Grady County. Damage from this satellite tornado was not discovered and was therefore rated F0. The 8th tornado, A8, developed 2.5 miles northwest of downtown Chickasha just north of US 62, and tracked northeast, striking the Chickasha Municipal Airport, resulting in high-end F2 damage to two hangar buildings and destroying several aircraft. An aircraft wing, believed to have originated from this airport was eventually carried airborne approximately 45 miles and dropped in southwest Oklahoma City. Approximately 20 mobile homes near the airport were either damaged or destroyed with several persons injured. The tornado then crossed US 81 about 2 miles north of its intersection with US 62 destroying a large building, then dissipated 4 miles north-northeast of downtown Chickasha. The 9th tornado, A9, was a violent and long-tracked tornado, and eventually produced F5 damage in Bridge Creek, Oklahoma City, and Moore. This tornado developed in Grady County about two miles south-southwest of Amber, and quickly intensified as it crossed State Highway 92. F4 damage was first discovered about 4 miles east-northeast of Amber and extended for 6 1/2 miles, as the tornado continued to move northeast. Two areas of F5 damage were observed. The first was in the Willow Lake Addition, a rural subdivision of mobile homes and some concrete slab homes, in Bridge Creek in far eastern Grady County. Two homes were completely swept from their concrete slabs, and about one dozen automobiles were carried about 1/4 of a mile. All mobile homes in this area in the direct path of the tornado were obliterated, resulting in a high concentration of fatalities. Asphalt pavement about 1-inch thick was also peeled from a section of rural road EW125. The second area of F5 damage was observed about 1 mile west of the Grady/McClain County line and consisted of a cleanly swept slab home with foundation anchor bolts and another vehicle lofted 1/4 of a mile. The maximum width of damage in Bridge Creek was estimated to be 1 mile. Approximately 200 mobile homes/houses were destroyed, and hundreds of other structures were damaged. The Ridgecrest Baptist Church in Bridge Creek was also destroyed. Twelve persons died in Bridge Creek, nine in mobile homes, and all fatalities and the majority of injuries were concentrated in the Willow Lake Addition, Southern Hills Addition, and Bridge Creek Estates, consisting mostly of mobile homes. Compared to sections of Oklahoma and Cleveland Counties, other counties in the path of this tornado which are more densely populated, eastern Grady County including the Bridge Creek area, is rural and sparsely populated. The tornado maintained a nearly straight path to the northeast paralleling Interstate 44, as it entered McClain County, except when it made a slight jog to the right and moved directly over the 16th Street overpass in Newcastle where a woman was killed when she was blown out from under the overpass. The tornado continued into northern sections of rural Newcastle and crossed the interstate again just north of the US 62 Newcastle interchange. While this tornado was moving through the northern portion of Newcastle, a satellite tornado (A10) touched down in a field in rural north Newcastle, and caused no damage (F0). Two areas of F4 damage were observed in McClain County, all associated with tornado A9. The first area overlapped the Grady/McClain County line and extended to about 3 miles northwest of Newcastle, ending just west of the 16th St. overpass on Interstate 44, while the other area was observed 2 miles northwest of Newcastle. Thirty-eight homes and 2 businesses were destroyed in McClain County, and 40 homes were damaged. Damage then diminished to F2 intensity as the tornado crossed the South Canadian River into northern Cleveland County.         The tornado entered Cleveland County between Portland and May and between SW 164th and SW 179th in south Oklahoma City. Damage was rated F2 in this area with a path width averaging 1/2 of a mile. The first major housing development to be struck in Cleveland County was Country Place Estates located just west of Pennsylvania Ave. where about 50 homes were damaged, with 1 dozen of these homes receiving F4 damage. One slab home was cleanly swept from its foundation, and several vehicles were picked up from the subdivision and tossed across Pennsylvania Ave, a distance of approximately 1/4 of a mile. One vehicle was found under a bridge just east of the intersection of Pennsylvania and SW 134th. This particular area of damage has been rated high F4/low F5. Oklahoma City Police indicated that part of an airplane wing, believed to have originated from Chickasha Municipal Airport in Grady County, landed in this area. The tornado then tracked through Eastlake Estates, a densely populated housing development, located north of SW 134th and between Pennsylvania and Western, where 3 fatalities occurred. Entire rows of homes were virtually flattened to piles of rubble. Four adjacent homes on one street were virtually cleaned off their foundations leaving only concrete slabs, which earned an F5 rating. Three other homes in this housing division also received F5 damage, with the remaining destruction rated high F4. Three persons also died in the 600-unit Emerald Springs Apartments on Western Ave. located across the street from Eastlake Estates. One 2-story apartment building on the north end of the apartment complex was virtually flattened, and received an F5 rating. Westmoore High School, located just north of Eastlake Estates, was also heavily damaged. Although a well-attended awards ceremony was being held at the school during the tornado, no one was injured, however dozens of vehicles in the school parking lot were either damaged or destroyed. F4 damage continued northeast into another residential area east of Western Ave. and south of 119th St. The tornado then entered the western city limits of Moore (Cleveland County) along Santa Fe and near NW 12th, and produced damage between 1/2 and 3/4 of a mile wide. Maximum damage, rated high F4/low F5, extended northeast to near Janeway with several large groups of homes flattened. Four persons died in this residential area. F4 damage continued to South Shields just north of the junction with Interstate 35. A woman was also killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass of Interstate 35. The tornado appeared to weaken just slightly after crossing interstate 35, however it remained a formidable storm with widespread high F3/low F4 damage observed in Highland Park, a residential area, south of the First Baptist Church on 27th St. in Moore. Escaping with relatively minor damage, and being located near the halfway point of the tornado path, the First Baptist Church in Moore eventually served as the primary coordination center for most tornado relief efforts. The tornado then continued northeast and entered the southern portion of a sparsely populated industrial district. F4 damage continued through this area, to near SE 89th St., the Cleveland/Oklahoma County border.   Moving into Oklahoma County, the tornado curved northward, through the remaining industrial district north of Interstate 240 where 2 businesses were destroyed, with the damage rated F4. Two persons were also killed at a trucking company near the intersection of S. Bryant Ave. and Interstate 240. A freight car, with an approximate weight of 18 tons, was picked up intermittently and blown 3/4 of a mile across an open field, with the body of the freight car being deposited southeast of the intersection of S. Sunnylane Rd. and SE 59th. Gouge marks were observed in the field every 50 to 100 yards, suggesting the freight car had been airborne for at least a short distance. While tornado A9 was moving through southeast Oklahoma City, another tornado (A11) touched down briefly about 1/2 mile south of Interstate 240 (Oklahoma County), near the intersection of SE 80th and Sooner Rd. Damage from tornado A11, rated F0, included fences being blown down and minor roof damage inflicted to a couple of houses. Tornado A9 then entered residential neighborhoods between SE 59th and SE 44th where 1 woman was killed in her house. Crossing SE 44th into Del City (Oklahoma County) the tornado moved through the highly populated Del Aire housing addition killing 6 persons and damaging or destroying hundreds of homes, many with F3/F4 damage. The tornado then crossed Sooner Rd., damaged an entry gate and several costly structures at Tinker Air Force Base, then crossed 29th St. into Midwest City (Oklahoma County), destroying 1 building in the Boeing Complex and damaging 2 others. Widespread F3/F4 damage continued as the tornado moved across Interstate 40 affecting a large business district. Approximately 800 vehicles were damaged at Hudiburg Auto Group, located just south of Interstate 40. Hundreds of the vehicles were moved from their original location, and dozens of vehicles were picked up and tossed northward across Interstate 40 into several motels, a distance of approximately 2 tenths of a mile. Numerous motels and other businesses including Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, Inn Suites, Clarion Inn, Cracker Barrel, and portions of Rose State College, were destroyed. Some of the damage through this area was rated high F4, however low F5 was considered. The tornado then continued into another residential area located between SE 15th and Reno Ave. where 3 fatalities occurred. High F4 damage was inflicted to 4 homes in this area. Two of these homes were located between SE 12th and SE 11th, near Buena Vista, and the other 2 homes were located on Will Rogers Rd. just south of SE 15th. Damage then diminished rapidly to F0/F1 as the tornado crossed Reno Ave. before dissipating 3 blocks north of Reno Ave. between Sooner Rd. and Air Depot Blvd. The Oklahoma State Department of Health in Oklahoma City recorded 36 direct fatalities. In addition, 5 persons died of illness or accident during or shortly after the tornado and were not considered in the direct fatality total. Five hundred eighty-three injuries were estimated based on numbers provided from the Department of Health, which were then adjusted to account for persons assumed to be unaccounted for. Injuries which resulted from removing debris, conducting search and rescue efforts, and taking shelter from the tornado, were not considered in the injury total. An estimated 1800 homes were destroyed, and 2500 homes were damaged, resulting in approximately 1 billion dollars in damage.  The 12th tornado, A12, formed about 3 miles southwest of Choctaw in Oklahoma County and produced F2 damage to two homes and lesser damage to many others in the southwest part of Choctaw. The tornado moved into the center of town where a car was thrown over the canopy at a drive-in-restaurant. The business strip located on the north side of NE 23rd was especially affected with several businesses destroyed, including Pizza Hut, Sonic, and Tri-City Youth and Family Shelter. Damage was mainly F1as it moved northeast, except for F2 damage at a nursing home where one woman was injured. The tornado continued to weaken in rural areas and dissipated near the intersection of NE 50th and Triple XXX Road. In total, damage estimates are near 3.2 million dollars, with 8 businesses destroyed, 130 businesses damaged, 14 homes destroyed, and 23 homes damaged. The 13th tornado, A13, formed about 4 miles east-southeast of Jones in Oklahoma County near the intersection of NE 63rd and Triple XXX Rd., and was captured on video. Only minor damage (F0), was observed as the tornado tracked northward along Triple XXX Rd. for 2 miles before dissipating near Britton. The 14th and final tornado (A14) produced by storm A, formed about 3 miles east-northeast of Jones in Oklahoma County just west of Triple XXX Rd and between Hefner and 122nd, then tracked northward for 4 miles before dissipating near Interstate 44. A ground survey concluded F1 damage occurred to several homes south of the intersection of Memorial and Triple XXX Rd.  Storm B was responsible for producing 20 tornadoes in 5 hours. One of these tornadoes, rated F4, caused 1 fatality, and produced a damage path 39 miles long and 1 mile wide. The first tornado, B1, formed about 3 miles south of Roosevelt in Kiowa County near Tom Steed Lake. Touchdown was brief with no damage reported (F0). The 2nd tornado, B2, formed in southwest Caddo County about 12 miles west-northwest of Apache. The tornado was captured on video and remained on the ground for approximately 4 minutes before dissipating. No damage was reported (F0). The 3rd tornado, B3, formed about 8 miles south of Fort Cobb and remained on the ground for 21 minutes covering a distance of 7 miles. Damage, mainly F1, consisted of a destroyed barn 7 miles south of Fort Cobb, a stock trailer which was thrown about 100 yards and a destroyed house garage 6 miles south-southeast of Fort Cobb, and sporadic areas of downed trees and power lines. The 4th tornado, B4, was short-lived and developed about 5 miles west of Anadarko in Caddo County. No significant damage was observed (F0). The 5th tornado, B5, was also short-lived and formed about 4 miles north-northwest of Anadarko in Caddo County. No significant damage was observed (F0). A storm chaser observed the 6th tornado, B6, about 4 miles east-southeast of Gracemont in Caddo County. Touchdown was brief with no significant damage (F0). The 7th tornado, B7, was also reported by a storm chaser, and formed about 9 miles east-southeast of Gracemont in Caddo County. The tornado was brief and produced no significant damage (F0). The 8th and 9th tornadoes, B8 and B9, formed nearly simultaneously. Tornado B8 developed about 8 miles west-southwest of Minco in Grady County and was approximately 300 yards wide. The tornado tracked northeast for 2 miles before dissipating. Tornado B9 formed 5 miles south of Cogar in Caddo County and tracked northward for 5 miles. Tornadoes B8 and B9 moved over rural areas with only extensive tree damage observed, and thus were both rated F1. The 10th tornado, B10, was captured on video and formed about 5 miles west of Minco and tracked northeast for 4 miles before dissipating. Maximum damage, rated F1, consisted of small house moved slightly off its foundation with most of its roof blown off. Trees and road signs were also damaged near the end of the tornado track. The 11th tornado, B11, formed about 5 miles southwest of Minco in Grady County and was observed by off-duty Storm Prediction Center forecasters. The roof was ripped off a house, which would normally warrant an F2 rating, however the structure was considered somewhat unstable, so an F1 rating was assigned. The 12th tornado, B12, formed about 2.5 miles west-northwest of Union City in Canadian County and was captured on video. No significant damage was observed and thus was rated F0. The 13th tornado, B13, formed about 2 miles north-northeast of Union City in Canadian County and was captured on video. No significant damage was reported (F0). The 14th tornado, B14, formed about 4 miles north-northeast of Union City in Canadian County and was also captured on video. No significant damage was reported (F0). The 15th tornado, B15, was also captured on video as it formed about 3 miles east-southeast of El Reno in Canadian County. No significant damage was reported (F0). The 16th tornado, B16, developed about 6 miles west-northwest of Yukon (Canadian County) and tracked northward for 6 miles before dissipating near Piedmont, also in Canadian County. Two witnesses caught this tornado on video. The majority of damage consisted of mangled and downed trees and downed power poles, however 2 mobile homes sustained heavy damage (F1); a barn was destroyed, and 1 cow was killed. The 17th tornado, B17, developed about 1.5 miles west of Piedmont in Canadian County and tracked northward for 8 miles in a zigzag pattern, ending in far south Kingfisher County. Again the majority of damage consisted of downed trees and power poles, however F2 damage was observed about 4 miles northwest of Piedmont where a garage, attached to the house, was destroyed, and a barn and mobile home were completely demolished with debris from the mobile home, mostly corrugated metal, scattered along a 2-mile stretch of road. F1 damage, consisting of large downed trees and leaning power poles, was observed in southern Kingfisher County. The 18th tornado, B18, developed about 4 miles north-northeast of Piedmont in northeast Canadian County and tracked northward for 10 miles before dissipating about 4 miles northwest of Cashion in Kingfisher County. F1 damage was observed in northeast Canadian County, where large trees were uprooted, and numerous power poles were felled or were leaning. F1 damage was also observed 2 miles west of Cashion in Kingfisher County where telephone/utility poles were downed for approximately 100 feet, and an oil storage tank was knocked off its mount. The 19th tornado, B19, formed about 12 miles south-southwest of Crescent in Logan County and was confirmed by an aerial survey. Damage, rated high F0/low F1, was observed for a distance of 1 mile and consisted mostly of downed power poles and strewn about bales of hay. A very unusual event took place in Logan County where 2 tornadoes, B20 and G5, produced by different thunderstorms, affected much of the same area between Crescent and Mulhall in Logan County. Assessment of damage from the individual tornadoes was difficult and in some areas nearly impossible due to overlapping damage paths. The 1st tornado, B20, formed about 7 miles southwest of Crescent and tracked northeast for 39 miles before dissipating east of Perry in Noble County. The 2nd tornado, G5, formed about 2 1/2 miles south of Crescent and tracked northeast for 13 miles before dissipating 4 miles southwest of Mulhall. Damage paths were nearly parallel in Logan County with damage from the 2nd tornado displaced 1/2 mile or less to the north of damage from the 1st tornado. Damage from B20 was first observed about 2 miles west of the intersection of SH33 and SH74 near Twin Lakes Rd., where 2 homes and other businesses were damaged. The width of damage is believed to have increased to nearly 1 mile as it tracked east of Crescent where numerous homes suffered major damage. Damage to 1 brick residence 3 miles east-southeast of Crescent was rated F4. All walls were knocked down, and part of the foundation was removed. The tornado then tracked through the small community of Abell (6 miles southwest of Mulhall), where 1 woman was killed in her home, and 6 persons were injured, and then finally through Mulhall. Approximately 60-70% of Mulhall's 130 homes were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, Mulhall's primary water source, a water tower, and the Mulhall/Orlando Elementary School were destroyed. Lesser damage continued to about 1/2 mile west of the Logan/Payne County border where tombstones and fences were blown over. Along Interstate 35 in northwest Payne County, a semi-truck trailer was overturned, and 2 cars were flipped. The driver of one of the cars was killed when his vehicle, parked under the Interstate 35 overpass at mile-marker 176.5, was picked up and dropped on its top. In Noble County, major structural damage was observed in the Boonsboro Addition, a mobile home park located along State Highway 86, 6 miles south of Perry. Approximately 20 mobile homes were destroyed, and dozens of others were damaged. Damage continued northward to a location 3 miles east of Perry, where 3 homes suffered major damage on US 64 and 1 critical injury was reported. In total, approximately 25 homes were destroyed in Noble County, and 50 homes were damaged.  The 2nd tornado, G5, occurred about 1 hour and 20 minutes after tornado B20, and also produced widespread damage. Twenty-five homes were destroyed near Crescent, and 30 homes were damaged (F3). Damage here is believed to have been produced by both tornadoes, and near the end of this tornado track, along portions of EW68 Rd. and EW69 Rd., another house received significant roof damage. Storm C spawned just 2 tornadoes. Both produced minimal damage in Canadian and Kingfisher Counties. The first tornado, C1, formed about 1.5 miles east of Okarche near the Canadian/Kingfisher County border and stayed on the ground for approximately 4 miles moving north-northeast. One barn was destroyed, while another was damaged. The structural integrity of the known destroyed barn warranted only an F0 rating. Tornado C2 touched down within the town of Okarche, which is on the Canadian/Kingfisher County border, and was photographed by Okarche residents. No damage was reported (F0). Storm D produced 4 tornadoes in the Norman National Weather Service warning area, however several tornadoes also formed from this thunderstorm in the Tulsa National Weather Service warning area. The 1st tornado, D1, formed 1mile north of the community of Etowah (15 miles south-southeast of Norman) in eastern Cleveland County and moved to the north-northeast damaging primarily trees (F0). The tornado then moved into Pottawatomie County and struck the community of Pink where the Pink Baptist Church, located on the south side of State Highway 9, 1.5 miles to the east of the Cleveland/Pottawatomie County line, was significantly damaged. The roof was taken off a new portion of the church, while the roof collapsed on the south side of the older portion of the church over the sanctuary leading to significant water damage. The church was primarily of a cinder block construction with a brick exterior. An F1 rating was applied at the church. A detached large, metal "gymnasium" building to the south of the church was also damaged with the southwest corner of the building caved in and support beams bent. The tornado continued to the northeast before dissipating just inside the city limits of Bethel Acres near Stevens Road, between Waco Road and Hardesty Road. With the exception of the church buildings, damage was limited to trees and power lines. The 2nd tornado, D2, formed in rural Pottawatomie County near Independence Road and Drummond Road or about 6 miles west-northwest of Downtown Shawnee. A few trees were damaged as the tornado moved northeast into the Clarks Heights addition along US-270, just south of Interstate 40. At 45th Street, a portion of a roof was blown off; a nursery was damaged; awnings were destroyed, and trees were downed. As the tornado crossed US-270, the air conditioner was taken off the roof of the El Charro restaurant. Continuing northeast into the West Gate neighborhood, fifteen homes suffered significant damage. Three homes were completely unroofed, warranting an F2 rating, and a number of others were partially unroofed. Other homes suffered shingle damage; a number of large trees were downed, and a garage was collapsed. Signs were also downed along the interstate adjacent to this neighborhood. The next area of significant damage was along the 38800 block of Garrett's Lake Road where a mobile home was destroyed, with the frame of the home blown 50 to 75 yards to the northwest. The disintegration of the mobile home indicated a high F1 or borderline F2 intensity in this area. A few hundred yards to the northeast, the warehouse of Shawnee Light Systems was damaged; one large metal storage building was unroofed, and other buildings were damaged. The tornado crossed Acme Road and struck a number of double-wide mobile homes along Valley View Drive, where one fatality and one serious injury occurred in the same home. The mobile homes most heavily damaged in this area were destroyed, but not disintegrated. To the north, a barn was destroyed, and trees were damaged as the tornado crossed Wolverine Road. The tornado then curved to the north-northwest crossing Acme Road damaging more trees before dissipating. The 3rd tornado, D3, touched down about a mile southeast of where D2 dissipated, or along Wolverine Road and 1/2 mile east of Acme Road just outside the Shawnee city limits in Pottawatomie County, where it destroyed an outbuilding and damaged trees. The tornado then moved northeast continuing to damage large trees before striking the Country Meadow housing addition in far north Shawnee. A number of homes in this neighborhood were damaged, two partially unroofed. The homes in this neighborhood appeared to be well-constructed and were approximately two to five years old. Damage here was consistent with high-end F1 damage. The tornado continued northeast downing power lines as it moved into Lincoln County 3 miles south-southwest of Meeker. At a point two miles south-southwest of Meeker, a double-wide mobile home was destroyed; a fifth wheel was tossed, and a large apple tree and a very large black jack oak tree were destroyed. The tornado then moved northeast into the eastern sections of Meeker. Along US Highway 62 a couple of buildings suffered shingle and roof damage; a business sign was destroyed; a shed was destroyed and carried north over the adjacent house, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage continued to a point four miles northeast of Meeker. Damage in Lincoln County was also rated F1. The final tornado (D4) produced by storm D formed 3 miles north-northeast of Sparks in Lincoln County. From this point extending north-northeast toward Davenport, only sporadic tree damage was observed. The tornado then inflicted scattered and mostly minor damage to houses and businesses in southeast portions of Davenport consistent with a high F0/low F1 rating, however a house just south of Davenport did lose more than half its roof. The tornado then continued northeastward toward Stroud remaining nearly parallel with Interstate 44 and State Route 66. In Stroud, the three largest employers of Stroud were heavily damaged. On the west side of Stroud along State Highway 66, the tornado hit the Sygma food distribution warehouse. The southeast section of the warehouse, a large free-span structure, suffered significant damage. Three semi-trucks at the warehouse were overturned. Some of the girders and siding from the warehouse were thrown to the northwest across State Highway 66. Farther east along State Highway 66 the Stroud Municipal Hospital suffered significant roof damage, which then caused significant water damage within the hospital. The pattern of the trees that were felled adjacent to the hospital suggested a multiple-vortex structure to the tornado at this point. Damage is estimated to be F2 along State Highway 66. As the tornado continued to move northeast along the turnpike, a McDonald's received minor damage, while an adjacent gas station had all its windows blown out. Semi-trucks parked in the gas station parking lot were also destroyed. On the north side of the turnpike on Old Stroud Road, a group of seven mobile homes was completely destroyed, three of which were lived in, however none were occupied when the tornado struck. The degree of destruction of these mobile homes indicated an F2 rating in this area. To the north, a large house being built (although most of the exterior of the house was completed) suffered roof and siding damage, especially on the east side. Much of the newly-laid interior wood flooring was destroyed by water. A number of homes in a neighborhood on the south side of the turnpike were damaged. At least two houses lost roofs with more minor roof and siding damage to others. Some of the worst damage, rated F3, occurred near the Tanger Outlet Mall, which was hit next by the tornado. Almost all of the stores suffered at least roof damage, however a section of 7 storefronts was destroyed. This section included four stores: Dress Barn, Corning, Mikasa, and a housewares store. At the eastern most section of the building, the exterior walls of the Levi's store collapsed inward. This store was a couple of hundred yards away from the other destroyed section. Local officials from Stroud had evacuated the mall before the tornado struck (approximately 2139 CST), and thus there were no fatalities or injuries in this area. Just south of the outlet mall, a Best Western motel lost part of its roof, and a Wendy's restaurant suffered a partially collapsed roof and broken windows. North of the outlet mall, a number of homes were damaged or destroyed in the Midway mobile home park. As the tornado moved northeast out of Stroud, a number of high-tension electrical towers were downed, and a few trees were downed before the tornado moved into Creek County (Tulsa National Weather Service warning area) about one mile north of the turnpike, dissipating south of Stroud Lake. Storm E produced 7 tornadoes, including an F4 tornado, that caused extensive damage to Dover in Kingfisher County. The 1st tornado, E1, was very brief and caused no damage (F0), as it formed about 3 miles west of Geary in Blaine County. The 2nd tornado, E2, formed in extreme northwest Canadian County and tracked northeast for 11 miles, clipping the southeast corner of Blaine County, before entering southwest Kingfisher County, eventually dissipating 7 miles south-southeast of Omega. Structural damage was confined mainly to outbuildings and roofs of a mobile home and house, however extensive tree damage with some large uprooted trees occurred along much of the tornado path, warranting an F1 rating in each county. The 3rd tornado, E3, formed 7 miles south-southeast of Omega in Kingfisher County and tracked northeast for 12 miles before dissipating 7 miles northwest of Kingfisher. Extensive tree damage and damage to 1 farmstead occurred during the first 2.5 miles of its path. The tornado then reached its maximum width of about 1/4 of a mile, 5 miles west-northwest of Kingfisher where a large, well-built brick home was severely damaged.  Although anchored to the foundation, half the walls were collapsed or missing, and the roof was gone, warranting an F3 rating. Along the remainder of the path, a handful of other homes had minor damage, and 7 mobile homes and numerous outbuildings were destroyed or severely damaged. There was also damage to trees, telephone poles, and farm equipment. The 4th tornado, E4, was short-lived and small, and has been referred to as a satellite tornado, and formed about 6 miles west of Kingfisher while tornado E3 was most intense. This tornado rotated around E3 for a short period of time before dissipating. No damage was observed (F0). Another satellite tornado, E5, formed 6 miles west-northwest of Kingfisher and also rotated briefly around E3. Its life-span was short, and there was no damage (F0). The 6th tornado, E6, produced a damage path 15 miles long and 1/2 mile wide as it tracked through Kingfisher County. The city of Dover took a direct hit. About one-third of Dover's structures were destroyed. The tornado formed 4 miles south-southwest of Dover, and traveled north-northeast crossing route 81 on the north side of Dover, dissipating about 7 miles east-southeast of Hennessey. F4 damage was observed on the west side of Dover where a steel-reinforced concrete building only had a few walls remaining; large vehicles were rendered apart; mobile homes frames were wrapped around tree trunks; and trees lost all their branches and most of their bark. One woman was killed inside a large frame home that collapsed. Approximately 34 mobile homes and houses were either damaged or destroyed in Dover. Outside of Dover, damage was rated primarily F1 and was confined to trees, telephone poles, farm equipment, and outbuildings. While tornado E6 continued moving northeast of Dover, another tornado, E7, formed about 3 miles northeast of Dover. This tornado formed near tornado E6 and tracked north-northeast for 4 miles over open county. F1 damage to trees, telephone poles, farm equipment, and outbuildings was observed.  To avoid confusion with F-scale ratings, no storm F was assigned. The fifth tornadic supercell, storm G, produced 6 tornadoes, 2 which produced F3 damage. The 1st tornado, G1, formed near the southwest edge of El Reno in Canadian County just southwest of Interstate 40 and County Club Rd. Minor damage, rated F0, was confined to trees, ballfield equipment at Redlands Community College, and a few roofs. The 2nd tornado, G2, formed about 1 mile northeast of El Reno in Canadian County and tracked north for 22 miles, varying in width from 100 to 500 yards, before dissipating 8 miles south-southwest of Kingfisher in Kingfisher County. Two mobile homes were destroyed, and 3 other homes received F1 damage. The remainder of damage was confined to telephone poles, trees, and outbuildings. About 2.5 miles into the path of the tornado, F2 damage occurred, and the top of a 500 ft. transmission tower was blown off. Near the end of the tornado path, F3 damage occurred about 9 miles southeast of Kingfisher, where a 3000 pound oil storage tank was moved for 1/2 of a mile. While the tank rolled for some distance, it was clear the tank was airborne. Trees in this area were also partially debarked. The 3rd tornado, G3, formed 2 miles southwest of Cashion in Kingfisher County and produced only minor damage, F0, as it tracked northeast for 3 miles to near the Kingfisher/Logan County border. The 4th tornado, G4, was very short-lived and formed about 8 miles east of Kingfisher in Kingfisher County. The tornado was less than 50 yards wide and damaged outbuildings and trees (F0) as it moved northeast across Highway 33. A description of the 5th tornado, G5, was listed above with tornado B20. Tornado G5 tracked over nearly the same portion of Logan County as tornado B20. At times, damage caused by tornado B20 was indistinguishable from damage caused by tornado G5. The 6th and final tornado (G6) produced by storm G, formed about 3 miles south-southwest of Mulhall in Logan County, just south of the damage track produced by another tornado (B20) that moved through Mulhall earlier in the evening. Although somewhat difficult to determine, due to possible damage from tornado B20, the most extensive damage (F2) from this tornado is believed to have consisted of major structural damage to a brick house near the intersection of Highway 77 and EW 68, where the majority of the roof was ripped off, and one exterior wall was partially knocked down. Additional damage occurred to a railroad crossing, trees, and power poles. Storm H spawned 4 tornadoes. The first tornado, H1, formed 2 miles east-southeast of Omega in Kingfisher County and was reported by a storm chaser. No significant damage is believed to have occurred (F0). The 2nd tornado, H2, formed about 3 miles northwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and was determined from storm chaser accounts and a damage survey. Damage, rated F0, consisted of snapped and uprooted trees. The 3rd tornado, H3, formed about 1 mile east-southeast of Hennessey in Kingfisher County and moved to the east-southeast for 1 mile. Major damage, rated high-end F2, was inflicted to one farm house and an old abandoned house near the beginning of the tornado track, and a handful of outbuildings were completely destroyed. Additionally, heavy farm equipment was moved several hundred yards, and trees sustained major damage. The 4th and final tornado, H4, formed 3 miles southwest of Marshall in Logan County and tracked over mostly rural land, affecting 2 residences before dissipating in southeast Garfield County. An old, abandoned house near Marshall in northwest Logan County was completely destroyed (F2). Damage at another residence in southeast Garfield County included 3 destroyed grain bins, 1 which was tossed about a 1/2 mile. A pole barn was also destroyed with the remnants strewn about a 150 yard wide area, and an addition to a house was ripped off. Massive trees some with trunk diameters the size of a small car where also ripped completely out of the ground and tossed up to 200 yards. This tree damage occurred over an area covering several miles and overlapped the Logan/Garfield County border. The final tornado producing thunderstorm, storm I, produced just one tornado. This tornado, I1, formed 6 miles south of Ringwood in Major County and unroofed an office building of a feed lot, while also damaging an irrigation system. Damage caused by this tornado was rated F1. There were also numerous reports of large hail and damaging straight-line winds during the tornado outbreak. Hail to the size of softballs (4.5 inches) smashed hundreds of vehicles and damaged many buildings 5 miles north of Altus in Jackson County.  At least 400 individual claims were received by local insurance offices with total damage near $800,000, and in Weatherford in Custer County, hail to the size of baseballs (2.75 inches) dented vehicles and broke many windows. Straight-line winds blew the roof off an apartment complex in the 100 block of McCormick in the Western Hills area of Weatherford in Custer County, ripped the roof off a barn 3 miles north of Altus in Jackson County, and blew out windows of a trailer 1 mile east of Blair in Jackson County. Straight-line winds also caused widespread tree damage 10 miles northeast of Hennessey in Kingfisher County, blew down power poles 5 miles east of Perry in Noble County, and knocked down large tree limbs 5 miles east-southeast of Elmer in Jackson County.     
368827	1999-05-03	TORNADO	OK	12	234	4.5e+08	0	Tornado A9 (Oklahoma County portion). See summary at end of May 3rd storm reports.  M67PH, F75PH, F49PH, M80PH, F60PH, M86PH, F43PH, M62PH, M0PH, F50PH, M37BU, M52BU A record outbreak of tornadoes struck Oklahoma from late afternoon of May 3, 1999, through early morning of May 4, 1999. To date, 58 tornadoes have been recorded across portions of western and central Oklahoma. Additional tornadoes were reported across eastern Oklahoma from late evening of May 3rd through the early morning of May 4th, and are listed under the eastern Oklahoma portion of Storm Data, provided by the National Weather Service Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. All direct fatalities (40) and all direct injuries (675) occurred in the Norman National Weather Service warning area. The most notable tornado was rated F5 and formed over Grady County near Amber and tracked northeast for 37 miles eventually into the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Bridge Creek, Oklahoma City, Moore, Del City, and Midwest City suffered tremendous damage. Thirty-six direct fatalities and 583 direct injuries were recorded. There were many other significant tornadoes as well, including F4 tornadoes in Kingfisher and Logan Counties, and F3 tornadoes in Caddo, Grady, Kingfisher, Logan, and Lincoln Counties. Due to the magnitude of the tornado outbreak, and for easier reference, each tornado has received its own identification. There were 8 tornadic producing thunderstorms, called supercells, and most of them spawned numerous tornadoes, one after another. Occasionally, these thunderstorms spawned tornadoes at the same time. The first tornado producing thunderstorm of the day was labeled storm A, while the last tornado producing thunderstorm of the day was labeled storm I. Tornadoes produced by the same supercell thunderstorm have the same letter and were then numbered chronologically.  For example, the 3rd tornado produced by storm B was labeled B3.    Storm A produced 14 tornadoes over a period of about 7 hours and was eventually responsible for the F5 tornado that struck Bridge Creek, Oklahoma City and Moore. The 1st tornado of the outbreak, A1, touched down on US 62, 2 miles north of Interstate 44 in Comanche County at 1641 CST. No damage is believed to have occurred (F0). The 2nd tornado, A2, formed approximately 3 miles west of Elgin in Comanche County. Several witnesses confirmed this tornado, however no damage was observed (F0). The 3rd tornado, A3, touched down in a rural area 3 miles east of Apache in Caddo County. As the tornado moved northward to near Anadarko, one house was destroyed near the town of Stecker, with its roof ripped off and several walls knocked down (F3). Three person inside the house were injured. Several witnesses reported the 4th tornado, A4, 3 miles northwest of Cyril in Caddo County just west of SH 8. No damage was reported (F0). The 5th tornado, A5, formed 2 miles south of Anadarko in Caddo County. Two witnesses reported the tornado to be brief, and no damage was observed (F0).  The 6th tornado, A6, developed about 3 miles north-northeast of Cement near the Caddo/Grady County border, and quickly intensified to a strong tornado with associated damage rated at the high end of the F3 scale. The tornado tracked northeast for 9 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles west-northwest of downtown Chickasha. Two homes had just a few interior walls standing (F3), one located near US 62 on the northwest side of Chickasha, and several wooden high tension power lines were downed. Several persons were injured south of Verden near the Caddo/Grady County border. The 7th tornado, A7, has been referred to as a satellite tornado, and rotated around A6 for a short period of time, 5 miles west of Chickasha in Grady County. Damage from this satellite tornado was not discovered and was therefore rated F0. The 8th tornado, A8, developed 2.5 miles northwest of downtown Chickasha just north of US 62, and tracked northeast, striking the Chickasha Municipal Airport, resulting in high-end F2 damage to two hangar buildings and destroying several aircraft. An aircraft wing, believed to have originated from this airport was eventually carried airborne approximately 45 miles and dropped in southwest Oklahoma City. Approximately 20 mobile homes near the airport were either damaged or destroyed with several persons injured. The tornado then crossed US 81 about 2 miles north of its intersection with US 62 destroying a large building, then dissipated 4 miles north-northeast of downtown Chickasha. The 9th tornado, A9, was a violent and long-tracked tornado, and eventually produced F5 damage in Bridge Creek, Oklahoma City, and Moore. This tornado developed in Grady County about two miles south-southwest of Amber, and quickly intensified as it crossed State Highway 92. F4 damage was first discovered about 4 miles east-northeast of Amber and extended for 6 1/2 miles, as the tornado continued to move northeast. Two areas of F5 damage were observed. The first was in the Willow Lake Addition, a rural subdivision of mobile homes and some concrete slab homes, in Bridge Creek in far eastern Grady County. Two homes were completely swept from their concrete slabs, and about one dozen automobiles were carried about 1/4 of a mile. All mobile homes in this area in the direct path of the tornado were obliterated, resulting in a high concentration of fatalities. Asphalt pavement about 1-inch thick was also peeled from a section of rural road EW125. The second area of F5 damage was observed about 1 mile west of the Grady/McClain County line and consisted of a cleanly swept slab home with foundation anchor bolts and another vehicle lofted 1/4 of a mile. The maximum width of damage in Bridge Creek was estimated to be 1 mile. Approximately 200 mobile homes/houses were destroyed, and hundreds of other structures were damaged. The Ridgecrest Baptist Church in Bridge Creek was also destroyed. Twelve persons died in Bridge Creek, nine in mobile homes, and all fatalities and the majority of injuries were concentrated in the Willow Lake Addition, Southern Hills Addition, and Bridge Creek Estates, consisting mostly of mobile homes. Compared to sections of Oklahoma and Cleveland Counties, other counties in the path of this tornado which are more densely populated, eastern Grady County including the Bridge Creek area, is rural and sparsely populated. The tornado maintained a nearly straight path to the northeast paralleling Interstate 44, as it entered McClain County, except when it made a slight jog to the right and moved directly over the 16th Street overpass in Newcastle where a woman was killed when she was blown out from under the overpass. The tornado continued into northern sections of rural Newcastle and crossed the interstate again just north of the US 62 Newcastle interchange. While this tornado was moving through the northern portion of Newcastle, a satellite tornado (A10) touched down in a field in rural north Newcastle, and caused no damage (F0). Two areas of F4 damage were observed in McClain County, all associated with tornado A9. The first area overlapped the Grady/McClain County line and extended to about 3 miles northwest of Newcastle, ending just west of the 16th St. overpass on Interstate 44, while the other area was observed 2 miles northwest of Newcastle. Thirty-eight homes and 2 businesses were destroyed in McClain County, and 40 homes were damaged. Damage then diminished to F2 intensity as the tornado crossed the South Canadian River into northern Cleveland County.         The tornado entered Cleveland County between Portland and May and between SW 164th and SW 179th in south Oklahoma City. Damage was rated F2 in this area with a path width averaging 1/2 of a mile. The first major housing development to be struck in Cleveland County was Country Place Estates located just west of Pennsylvania Ave. where about 50 homes were damaged, with 1 dozen of these homes receiving F4 damage. One slab home was cleanly swept from its foundation, and several vehicles were picked up from the subdivision and tossed across Pennsylvania Ave, a distance of approximately 1/4 of a mile. One vehicle was found under a bridge just east of the intersection of Pennsylvania and SW 134th. This particular area of damage has been rated high F4/low F5. Oklahoma City Police indicated that part of an airplane wing, believed to have originated from Chickasha Municipal Airport in Grady County, landed in this area. The tornado then tracked through Eastlake Estates, a densely populated housing development, located north of SW 134th and between Pennsylvania and Western, where 3 fatalities occurred. Entire rows of homes were virtually flattened to piles of rubble. Four adjacent homes on one street were virtually cleaned off their foundations leaving only concrete slabs, which earned an F5 rating. Three other homes in this housing division also received F5 damage, with the remaining destruction rated high F4. Three persons also died in the 600-unit Emerald Springs Apartments on Western Ave. located across the street from Eastlake Estates. One 2-story apartment building on the north end of the apartment complex was virtually flattened, and received an F5 rating. Westmoore High School, located just north of Eastlake Estates, was also heavily damaged. Although a well-attended awards ceremony was being held at the school during the tornado, no one was injured, however dozens of vehicles in the school parking lot were either damaged or destroyed. F4 damage continued northeast into another residential area east of Western Ave. and south of 119th St. The tornado then entered the western city limits of Moore (Cleveland County) along Santa Fe and near NW 12th, and produced damage between 1/2 and 3/4 of a mile wide. Maximum damage, rated high F4/low F5, extended northeast to near Janeway with several large groups of homes flattened. Four persons died in this residential area. F4 damage continued to South Shields just north of the junction with Interstate 35. A woman was also killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass of Interstate 35. The tornado appeared to weaken just slightly after crossing interstate 35, however it remained a formidable storm with widespread high F3/low F4 damage observed in Highland Park, a residential area, south of the First Baptist Church on 27th St. in Moore. Escaping with relatively minor damage, and being located near the halfway point of the tornado path, the First Baptist Church in Moore eventually served as the primary coordination center for most tornado relief efforts. The tornado then continued northeast and entered the southern portion of a sparsely populated industrial district. F4 damage continued through this area, to near SE 89th St., the Cleveland/Oklahoma County border.   Moving into Oklahoma County, the tornado curved northward, through the remaining industrial district north of Interstate 240 where 2 businesses were destroyed, with the damage rated F4. Two persons were also killed at a trucking company near the intersection of S. Bryant Ave. and Interstate 240. A freight car, with an approximate weight of 18 tons, was picked up intermittently and blown 3/4 of a mile across an open field, with the body of the freight car being deposited southeast of the intersection of S. Sunnylane Rd. and SE 59th. Gouge marks were observed in the field every 50 to 100 yards, suggesting the freight car had been airborne for at least a short distance. While tornado A9 was moving through southeast Oklahoma City, another tornado (A11) touched down briefly about 1/2 mile south of Interstate 240 (Oklahoma County), near the intersection of SE 80th and Sooner Rd. Damage from tornado A11, rated F0, included fences being blown down and minor roof damage inflicted to a couple of houses. Tornado A9 then entered residential neighborhoods between SE 59th and SE 44th where 1 woman was killed in her house. Crossing SE 44th into Del City (Oklahoma County) the tornado moved through the highly populated Del Aire housing addition killing 6 persons and damaging or destroying hundreds of homes, many with F3/F4 damage. The tornado then crossed Sooner Rd., damaged an entry gate and several costly structures at Tinker Air Force Base, then crossed 29th St. into Midwest City (Oklahoma County), destroying 1 building in the Boeing Complex and damaging 2 others. Widespread F3/F4 damage continued as the tornado moved across Interstate 40 affecting a large business district. Approximately 800 vehicles were damaged at Hudiburg Auto Group, located just south of Interstate 40. Hundreds of the vehicles were moved from their original location, and dozens of vehicles were picked up and tossed northward across Interstate 40 into several motels, a distance of approximately 2 tenths of a mile. Numerous motels and other businesses including Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, Inn Suites, Clarion Inn, Cracker Barrel, and portions of Rose State College, were destroyed. Some of the damage through this area was rated high F4, however low F5 was considered. The tornado then continued into another residential area located between SE 15th and Reno Ave. where 3 fatalities occurred. High F4 damage was inflicted to 4 homes in this area. Two of these homes were located between SE 12th and SE 11th, near Buena Vista, and the other 2 homes were located on Will Rogers Rd. just south of SE 15th. Damage then diminished rapidly to F0/F1 as the tornado crossed Reno Ave. before dissipating 3 blocks north of Reno Ave. between Sooner Rd. and Air Depot Blvd. The Oklahoma State Department of Health in Oklahoma City recorded 36 direct fatalities. In addition, 5 persons died of illness or accident during or shortly after the tornado and were not considered in the direct fatality total. Five hundred eighty-three injuries were estimated based on numbers provided from the Department of Health, which were then adjusted to account for persons assumed to be unaccounted for. Injuries which resulted from removing debris, conducting search and rescue efforts, and taking shelter from the tornado, were not considered in the injury total. An estimated 1800 homes were destroyed, and 2500 homes were damaged, resulting in approximately 1 billion dollars in damage.  The 12th tornado, A12, formed about 3 miles southwest of Choctaw in Oklahoma County and produced F2 damage to two homes and lesser damage to many others in the southwest part of Choctaw. The tornado moved into the center of town where a car was thrown over the canopy at a drive-in-restaurant. The business strip located on the north side of NE 23rd was especially affected with several businesses destroyed, including Pizza Hut, Sonic, and Tri-City Youth and Family Shelter. Damage was mainly F1as it moved northeast, except for F2 damage at a nursing home where one woman was injured. The tornado continued to weaken in rural areas and dissipated near the intersection of NE 50th and Triple XXX Road. In total, damage estimates are near 3.2 million dollars, with 8 businesses destroyed, 130 businesses damaged, 14 homes destroyed, and 23 homes damaged. The 13th tornado, A13, formed about 4 miles east-southeast of Jones in Oklahoma County near the intersection of NE 63rd and Triple XXX Rd., and was captured on video. Only minor damage (F0), was observed as the tornado tracked northward along Triple XXX Rd. for 2 miles before dissipating near Britton. The 14th and final tornado (A14) produced by storm A, formed about 3 miles east-northeast of Jones in Oklahoma County just west of Triple XXX Rd and between Hefner and 122nd, then tracked northward for 4 miles before dissipating near Interstate 44. A ground survey concluded F1 damage occurred to several homes south of the intersection of Memorial and Triple XXX Rd.  Storm B was responsible for producing 20 tornadoes in 5 hours. One of these tornadoes, rated F4, caused 1 fatality, and produced a damage path 39 miles long and 1 mile wide. The first tornado, B1, formed about 3 miles south of Roosevelt in Kiowa County near Tom Steed Lake. Touchdown was brief with no damage reported (F0). The 2nd tornado, B2, formed in southwest Caddo County about 12 miles west-northwest of Apache. The tornado was captured on video and remained on the ground for approximately 4 minutes before dissipating. No damage was reported (F0). The 3rd tornado, B3, formed about 8 miles south of Fort Cobb and remained on the ground for 21 minutes covering a distance of 7 miles. Damage, mainly F1, consisted of a destroyed barn 7 miles south of Fort Cobb, a stock trailer which was thrown about 100 yards and a destroyed house garage 6 miles south-southeast of Fort Cobb, and sporadic areas of downed trees and power lines. The 4th tornado, B4, was short-lived and developed about 5 miles west of Anadarko in Caddo County. No significant damage was observed (F0). The 5th tornado, B5, was also short-lived and formed about 4 miles north-northwest of Anadarko in Caddo County. No significant damage was observed (F0). A storm chaser observed the 6th tornado, B6, about 4 miles east-southeast of Gracemont in Caddo County. Touchdown was brief with no significant damage (F0). The 7th tornado, B7, was also reported by a storm chaser, and formed about 9 miles east-southeast of Gracemont in Caddo County. The tornado was brief and produced no significant damage (F0). The 8th and 9th tornadoes, B8 and B9, formed nearly simultaneously. Tornado B8 developed about 8 miles west-southwest of Minco in Grady County and was approximately 300 yards wide. The tornado tracked northeast for 2 miles before dissipating. Tornado B9 formed 5 miles south of Cogar in Caddo County and tracked northward for 5 miles. Tornadoes B8 and B9 moved over rural areas with only extensive tree damage observed, and thus were both rated F1. The 10th tornado, B10, was captured on video and formed about 5 miles west of Minco and tracked northeast for 4 miles before dissipating. Maximum damage, rated F1, consisted of small house moved slightly off its foundation with most of its roof blown off. Trees and road signs were also damaged near the end of the tornado track. The 11th tornado, B11, formed about 5 miles southwest of Minco in Grady County and was observed by off-duty Storm Prediction Center forecasters. The roof was ripped off a house, which would normally warrant an F2 rating, however the structure was considered somewhat unstable, so an F1 rating was assigned. The 12th tornado, B12, formed about 2.5 miles west-northwest of Union City in Canadian County and was captured on video. No significant damage was observed and thus was rated F0. The 13th tornado, B13, formed about 2 miles north-northeast of Union City in Canadian County and was captured on video. No significant damage was reported (F0). The 14th tornado, B14, formed about 4 miles north-northeast of Union City in Canadian County and was also captured on video. No significant damage was reported (F0). The 15th tornado, B15, was also captured on video as it formed about 3 miles east-southeast of El Reno in Canadian County. No significant damage was reported (F0). The 16th tornado, B16, developed about 6 miles west-northwest of Yukon (Canadian County) and tracked northward for 6 miles before dissipating near Piedmont, also in Canadian County. Two witnesses caught this tornado on video. The majority of damage consisted of mangled and downed trees and downed power poles, however 2 mobile homes sustained heavy damage (F1); a barn was destroyed, and 1 cow was killed. The 17th tornado, B17, developed about 1.5 miles west of Piedmont in Canadian County and tracked northward for 8 miles in a zigzag pattern, ending in far south Kingfisher County. Again the majority of damage consisted of downed trees and power poles, however F2 damage was observed about 4 miles northwest of Piedmont where a garage, attached to the house, was destroyed, and a barn and mobile home were completely demolished with debris from the mobile home, mostly corrugated metal, scattered along a 2-mile stretch of road. F1 damage, consisting of large downed trees and leaning power poles, was observed in southern Kingfisher County. The 18th tornado, B18, developed about 4 miles north-northeast of Piedmont in northeast Canadian County and tracked northward for 10 miles before dissipating about 4 miles northwest of Cashion in Kingfisher County. F1 damage was observed in northeast Canadian County, where large trees were uprooted, and numerous power poles were felled or were leaning. F1 damage was also observed 2 miles west of Cashion in Kingfisher County where telephone/utility poles were downed for approximately 100 feet, and an oil storage tank was knocked off its mount. The 19th tornado, B19, formed about 12 miles south-southwest of Crescent in Logan County and was confirmed by an aerial survey. Damage, rated high F0/low F1, was observed for a distance of 1 mile and consisted mostly of downed power poles and strewn about bales of hay. A very unusual event took place in Logan County where 2 tornadoes, B20 and G5, produced by different thunderstorms, affected much of the same area between Crescent and Mulhall in Logan County. Assessment of damage from the individual tornadoes was difficult and in some areas nearly impossible due to overlapping damage paths. The 1st tornado, B20, formed about 7 miles southwest of Crescent and tracked northeast for 39 miles before dissipating east of Perry in Noble County. The 2nd tornado, G5, formed about 2 1/2 miles south of Crescent and tracked northeast for 13 miles before dissipating 4 miles southwest of Mulhall. Damage paths were nearly parallel in Logan County with damage from the 2nd tornado displaced 1/2 mile or less to the north of damage from the 1st tornado. Damage from B20 was first observed about 2 miles west of the intersection of SH33 and SH74 near Twin Lakes Rd., where 2 homes and other businesses were damaged. The width of damage is believed to have increased to nearly 1 mile as it tracked east of Crescent where numerous homes suffered major damage. Damage to 1 brick residence 3 miles east-southeast of Crescent was rated F4. All walls were knocked down, and part of the foundation was removed. The tornado then tracked through the small community of Abell (6 miles southwest of Mulhall), where 1 woman was killed in her home, and 6 persons were injured, and then finally through Mulhall. Approximately 60-70% of Mulhall's 130 homes were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, Mulhall's primary water source, a water tower, and the Mulhall/Orlando Elementary School were destroyed. Lesser damage continued to about 1/2 mile west of the Logan/Payne County border where tombstones and fences were blown over. Along Interstate 35 in northwest Payne County, a semi-truck trailer was overturned, and 2 cars were flipped. The driver of one of the cars was killed when his vehicle, parked under the Interstate 35 overpass at mile-marker 176.5, was picked up and dropped on its top. In Noble County, major structural damage was observed in the Boonsboro Addition, a mobile home park located along State Highway 86, 6 miles south of Perry. Approximately 20 mobile homes were destroyed, and dozens of others were damaged. Damage continued northward to a location 3 miles east of Perry, where 3 homes suffered major damage on US 64 and 1 critical injury was reported. In total, approximately 25 homes were destroyed in Noble County, and 50 homes were damaged.  The 2nd tornado, G5, occurred about 1 hour and 20 minutes after tornado B20, and also produced widespread damage. Twenty-five homes were destroyed near Crescent, and 30 homes were damaged (F3). Damage here is believed to have been produced by both tornadoes, and near the end of this tornado track, along portions of EW68 Rd. and EW69 Rd., another house received significant roof damage. Storm C spawned just 2 tornadoes. Both produced minimal damage in Canadian and Kingfisher Counties. The first tornado, C1, formed about 1.5 miles east of Okarche near the Canadian/Kingfisher County border and stayed on the ground for approximately 4 miles moving north-northeast. One barn was destroyed, while another was damaged. The structural integrity of the known destroyed barn warranted only an F0 rating. Tornado C2 touched down within the town of Okarche, which is on the Canadian/Kingfisher County border, and was photographed by Okarche residents. No damage was reported (F0). Storm D produced 4 tornadoes in the Norman National Weather Service warning area, however several tornadoes also formed from this thunderstorm in the Tulsa National Weather Service warning area. The 1st tornado, D1, formed 1mile north of the community of Etowah (15 miles south-southeast of Norman) in eastern Cleveland County and moved to the north-northeast damaging primarily trees (F0). The tornado then moved into Pottawatomie County and struck the community of Pink where the Pink Baptist Church, located on the south side of State Highway 9, 1.5 miles to the east of the Cleveland/Pottawatomie County line, was significantly damaged. The roof was taken off a new portion of the church, while the roof collapsed on the south side of the older portion of the church over the sanctuary leading to significant water damage. The church was primarily of a cinder block construction with a brick exterior. An F1 rating was applied at the church. A detached large, metal "gymnasium" building to the south of the church was also damaged with the southwest corner of the building caved in and support beams bent. The tornado continued to the northeast before dissipating just inside the city limits of Bethel Acres near Stevens Road, between Waco Road and Hardesty Road. With the exception of the church buildings, damage was limited to trees and power lines. The 2nd tornado, D2, formed in rural Pottawatomie County near Independence Road and Drummond Road or about 6 miles west-northwest of Downtown Shawnee. A few trees were damaged as the tornado moved northeast into the Clarks Heights addition along US-270, just south of Interstate 40. At 45th Street, a portion of a roof was blown off; a nursery was damaged; awnings were destroyed, and trees were downed. As the tornado crossed US-270, the air conditioner was taken off the roof of the El Charro restaurant. Continuing northeast into the West Gate neighborhood, fifteen homes suffered significant damage. Three homes were completely unroofed, warranting an F2 rating, and a number of others were partially unroofed. Other homes suffered shingle damage; a number of large trees were downed, and a garage was collapsed. Signs were also downed along the interstate adjacent to this neighborhood. The next area of significant damage was along the 38800 block of Garrett's Lake Road where a mobile home was destroyed, with the frame of the home blown 50 to 75 yards to the northwest. The disintegration of the mobile home indicated a high F1 or borderline F2 intensity in this area. A few hundred yards to the northeast, the warehouse of Shawnee Light Systems was damaged; one large metal storage building was unroofed, and other buildings were damaged. The tornado crossed Acme Road and struck a number of double-wide mobile homes along Valley View Drive, where one fatality and one serious injury occurred in the same home. The mobile homes most heavily damaged in this area were destroyed, but not disintegrated. To the north, a barn was destroyed, and trees were damaged as the tornado crossed Wolverine Road. The tornado then curved to the north-northwest crossing Acme Road damaging more trees before dissipating. The 3rd tornado, D3, touched down about a mile southeast of where D2 dissipated, or along Wolverine Road and 1/2 mile east of Acme Road just outside the Shawnee city limits in Pottawatomie County, where it destroyed an outbuilding and damaged trees. The tornado then moved northeast continuing to damage large trees before striking the Country Meadow housing addition in far north Shawnee. A number of homes in this neighborhood were damaged, two partially unroofed. The homes in this neighborhood appeared to be well-constructed and were approximately two to five years old. Damage here was consistent with high-end F1 damage. The tornado continued northeast downing power lines as it moved into Lincoln County 3 miles south-southwest of Meeker. At a point two miles south-southwest of Meeker, a double-wide mobile home was destroyed; a fifth wheel was tossed, and a large apple tree and a very large black jack oak tree were destroyed. The tornado then moved northeast into the eastern sections of Meeker. Along US Highway 62 a couple of buildings suffered shingle and roof damage; a business sign was destroyed; a shed was destroyed and carried north over the adjacent house, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage continued to a point four miles northeast of Meeker. Damage in Lincoln County was also rated F1. The final tornado (D4) produced by storm D formed 3 miles north-northeast of Sparks in Lincoln County. From this point extending north-northeast toward Davenport, only sporadic tree damage was observed. The tornado then inflicted scattered and mostly minor damage to houses and businesses in southeast portions of Davenport consistent with a high F0/low F1 rating, however a house just south of Davenport did lose more than half its roof. The tornado then continued northeastward toward Stroud remaining nearly parallel with Interstate 44 and State Route 66. In Stroud, the three largest employers of Stroud were heavily damaged. On the west side of Stroud along State Highway 66, the tornado hit the Sygma food distribution warehouse. The southeast section of the warehouse, a large free-span structure, suffered significant damage. Three semi-trucks at the warehouse were overturned. Some of the girders and siding from the warehouse were thrown to the northwest across State Highway 66. Farther east along State Highway 66 the Stroud Municipal Hospital suffered significant roof damage, which then caused significant water damage within the hospital. The pattern of the trees that were felled adjacent to the hospital suggested a multiple-vortex structure to the tornado at this point. Damage is estimated to be F2 along State Highway 66. As the tornado continued to move northeast along the turnpike, a McDonald's received minor damage, while an adjacent gas station had all its windows blown out. Semi-trucks parked in the gas station parking lot were also destroyed. On the north side of the turnpike on Old Stroud Road, a group of seven mobile homes was completely destroyed, three of which were lived in, however none were occupied when the tornado struck. The degree of destruction of these mobile homes indicated an F2 rating in this area. To the north, a large house being built (although most of the exterior of the house was completed) suffered roof and siding damage, especially on the east side. Much of the newly-laid interior wood flooring was destroyed by water. A number of homes in a neighborhood on the south side of the turnpike were damaged. At least two houses lost roofs with more minor roof and siding damage to others. Some of the worst damage, rated F3, occurred near the Tanger Outlet Mall, which was hit next by the tornado. Almost all of the stores suffered at least roof damage, however a section of 7 storefronts was destroyed. This section included four stores: Dress Barn, Corning, Mikasa, and a housewares store. At the eastern most section of the building, the exterior walls of the Levi's store collapsed inward. This store was a couple of hundred yards away from the other destroyed section. Local officials from Stroud had evacuated the mall before the tornado struck (approximately 2139 CST), and thus there were no fatalities or injuries in this area. Just south of the outlet mall, a Best Western motel lost part of its roof, and a Wendy's restaurant suffered a partially collapsed roof and broken windows. North of the outlet mall, a number of homes were damaged or destroyed in the Midway mobile home park. As the tornado moved northeast out of Stroud, a number of high-tension electrical towers were downed, and a few trees were downed before the tornado moved into Creek County (Tulsa National Weather Service warning area) about one mile north of the turnpike, dissipating south of Stroud Lake. Storm E produced 7 tornadoes, including an F4 tornado, that caused extensive damage to Dover in Kingfisher County. The 1st tornado, E1, was very brief and caused no damage (F0), as it formed about 3 miles west of Geary in Blaine County. The 2nd tornado, E2, formed in extreme northwest Canadian County and tracked northeast for 11 miles, clipping the southeast corner of Blaine County, before entering southwest Kingfisher County, eventually dissipating 7 miles south-southeast of Omega. Structural damage was confined mainly to outbuildings and roofs of a mobile home and house, however extensive tree damage with some large uprooted trees occurred along much of the tornado path, warranting an F1 rating in each county. The 3rd tornado, E3, formed 7 miles south-southeast of Omega in Kingfisher County and tracked northeast for 12 miles before dissipating 7 miles northwest of Kingfisher. Extensive tree damage and damage to 1 farmstead occurred during the first 2.5 miles of its path. The tornado then reached its maximum width of about 1/4 of a mile, 5 miles west-northwest of Kingfisher where a large, well-built brick home was severely damaged.  Although anchored to the foundation, half the walls were collapsed or missing, and the roof was gone, warranting an F3 rating. Along the remainder of the path, a handful of other homes had minor damage, and 7 mobile homes and numerous outbuildings were destroyed or severely damaged. There was also damage to trees, telephone poles, and farm equipment. The 4th tornado, E4, was short-lived and small, and has been referred to as a satellite tornado, and formed about 6 miles west of Kingfisher while tornado E3 was most intense. This tornado rotated around E3 for a short period of time before dissipating. No damage was observed (F0). Another satellite tornado, E5, formed 6 miles west-northwest of Kingfisher and also rotated briefly around E3. Its life-span was short, and there was no damage (F0). The 6th tornado, E6, produced a damage path 15 miles long and 1/2 mile wide as it tracked through Kingfisher County. The city of Dover took a direct hit. About one-third of Dover's structures were destroyed. The tornado formed 4 miles south-southwest of Dover, and traveled north-northeast crossing route 81 on the north side of Dover, dissipating about 7 miles east-southeast of Hennessey. F4 damage was observed on the west side of Dover where a steel-reinforced concrete building only had a few walls remaining; large vehicles were rendered apart; mobile homes frames were wrapped around tree trunks; and trees lost all their branches and most of their bark. One woman was killed inside a large frame home that collapsed. Approximately 34 mobile homes and houses were either damaged or destroyed in Dover. Outside of Dover, damage was rated primarily F1 and was confined to trees, telephone poles, farm equipment, and outbuildings. While tornado E6 continued moving northeast of Dover, another tornado, E7, formed about 3 miles northeast of Dover. This tornado formed near tornado E6 and tracked north-northeast for 4 miles over open county. F1 damage to trees, telephone poles, farm equipment, and outbuildings was observed.  To avoid confusion with F-scale ratings, no storm F was assigned. The fifth tornadic supercell, storm G, produced 6 tornadoes, 2 which produced F3 damage. The 1st tornado, G1, formed near the southwest edge of El Reno in Canadian County just southwest of Interstate 40 and County Club Rd. Minor damage, rated F0, was confined to trees, ballfield equipment at Redlands Community College, and a few roofs. The 2nd tornado, G2, formed about 1 mile northeast of El Reno in Canadian County and tracked north for 22 miles, varying in width from 100 to 500 yards, before dissipating 8 miles south-southwest of Kingfisher in Kingfisher County. Two mobile homes were destroyed, and 3 other homes received F1 damage. The remainder of damage was confined to telephone poles, trees, and outbuildings. About 2.5 miles into the path of the tornado, F2 damage occurred, and the top of a 500 ft. transmission tower was blown off. Near the end of the tornado path, F3 damage occurred about 9 miles southeast of Kingfisher, where a 3000 pound oil storage tank was moved for 1/2 of a mile. While the tank rolled for some distance, it was clear the tank was airborne. Trees in this area were also partially debarked. The 3rd tornado, G3, formed 2 miles southwest of Cashion in Kingfisher County and produced only minor damage, F0, as it tracked northeast for 3 miles to near the Kingfisher/Logan County border. The 4th tornado, G4, was very short-lived and formed about 8 miles east of Kingfisher in Kingfisher County. The tornado was less than 50 yards wide and damaged outbuildings and trees (F0) as it moved northeast across Highway 33. A description of the 5th tornado, G5, was listed above with tornado B20. Tornado G5 tracked over nearly the same portion of Logan County as tornado B20. At times, damage caused by tornado B20 was indistinguishable from damage caused by tornado G5. The 6th and final tornado (G6) produced by storm G, formed about 3 miles south-southwest of Mulhall in Logan County, just south of the damage track produced by another tornado (B20) that moved through Mulhall earlier in the evening. Although somewhat difficult to determine, due to possible damage from tornado B20, the most extensive damage (F2) from this tornado is believed to have consisted of major structural damage to a brick house near the intersection of Highway 77 and EW 68, where the majority of the roof was ripped off, and one exterior wall was partially knocked down. Additional damage occurred to a railroad crossing, trees, and power poles. Storm H spawned 4 tornadoes. The first tornado, H1, formed 2 miles east-southeast of Omega in Kingfisher County and was reported by a storm chaser. No significant damage is believed to have occurred (F0). The 2nd tornado, H2, formed about 3 miles northwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and was determined from storm chaser accounts and a damage survey. Damage, rated F0, consisted of snapped and uprooted trees. The 3rd tornado, H3, formed about 1 mile east-southeast of Hennessey in Kingfisher County and moved to the east-southeast for 1 mile. Major damage, rated high-end F2, was inflicted to one farm house and an old abandoned house near the beginning of the tornado track, and a handful of outbuildings were completely destroyed. Additionally, heavy farm equipment was moved several hundred yards, and trees sustained major damage. The 4th and final tornado, H4, formed 3 miles southwest of Marshall in Logan County and tracked over mostly rural land, affecting 2 residences before dissipating in southeast Garfield County. An old, abandoned house near Marshall in northwest Logan County was completely destroyed (F2). Damage at another residence in southeast Garfield County included 3 destroyed grain bins, 1 which was tossed about a 1/2 mile. A pole barn was also destroyed with the remnants strewn about a 150 yard wide area, and an addition to a house was ripped off. Massive trees some with trunk diameters the size of a small car where also ripped completely out of the ground and tossed up to 200 yards. This tree damage occurred over an area covering several miles and overlapped the Logan/Garfield County border. The final tornado producing thunderstorm, storm I, produced just one tornado. This tornado, I1, formed 6 miles south of Ringwood in Major County and unroofed an office building of a feed lot, while also damaging an irrigation system. Damage caused by this tornado was rated F1. There were also numerous reports of large hail and damaging straight-line winds during the tornado outbreak. Hail to the size of softballs (4.5 inches) smashed hundreds of vehicles and damaged many buildings 5 miles north of Altus in Jackson County.  At least 400 individual claims were received by local insurance offices with total damage near $800,000, and in Weatherford in Custer County, hail to the size of baseballs (2.75 inches) dented vehicles and broke many windows. Straight-line winds blew the roof off an apartment complex in the 100 block of McCormick in the Western Hills area of Weatherford in Custer County, ripped the roof off a barn 3 miles north of Altus in Jackson County, and blew out windows of a trailer 1 mile east of Blair in Jackson County. Straight-line winds also caused widespread tree damage 10 miles northeast of Hennessey in Kingfisher County, blew down power poles 5 miles east of Perry in Noble County, and knocked down large tree limbs 5 miles east-southeast of Elmer in Jackson County.     
371057	1999-07-01	DROUGHT	PA	0	0	0	5e+08	Governor Ridge declared a drought emergency in 55 of the 67 counties of Pennsylvania following extended dry weather through much of the summer.  Water usage was restricted.  Precipitation deficits for many counties for the months of May through July averaged between 5 and 7 inches.  Precipitation departures for the 365 day period ending in mid-July were over 1 foot below normal in many places.  This is about one-third of total annual normal precipitation in most areas.  Streams were empty, wells dried up, and the Susquehanna River hit record low flows.  Hot sunny days combined with the dry weather to take a large toll on crops.  Preliminary estimates by the Department of Agriculture indicated possible crop losses in excess of $500 million.  The figure did not include a 20% decrease in milk production due to the drought that would also result in million dollar losses.  There were some counties that experienced 70 to 100% crop loss.  At least 30% losses are needed for a drought disaster declaration. 
374557	1999-05-04	TORNADO	TX	0	22	1.25e+08	0	This tornado moved directly through the downtown district of De Kalb and across a high school.  Numerous homes and businesses were severely damaged or destroyed.  The high school suffered severe damage.  Sirens sounded 15 minutes prior to arrival of the storm.  The damage resulted in a Presidential Disaster Declaration.  This tornado moved from Red River county, TX across Bowie county, TX into Little River county, AR. 
376412	1999-08-11	TORNADO	UT	1	80	1.7e+08	5e+05	Around lunch time, a tornado touched down in the southwest portions of Salt Lake City. The tornado intensified to an F2 on the Fujita scale, and moved northeast through the metropolitan area of Salt Lake City. It caused widespread damage at the Delta Center, then ripped across an outdoor retailers convention tent, where the lone fatality occurred along with many of the injuries. After blowing out many windows in the Wyndam Hotel, the tornado continued its northeast track, knocking down scaffolding and shearing off a crane at the LDS Assembly Hall construction site. Next it skirted the Capitol Building, ripping out several large trees there and in historic Memory Grove. It then moved into the residential area known as The Avenues, damaging hundreds of trees and ripping the roofs off of several homes, before finally lifting back into the clouds. All told, there was 1 fatality, 80 injured, 300 buildings and homes sustained damage, with 34 homes deemed uninhabitable. At least 500 trees were totally destroyed, with 300 more damaged.

381498	2000-12-12	ICE STORM	AR	0	0	3.6e+08	0	An arctic air mass spilled southward out of the central plains and into the lower Mississippi Valley.  This cold, surface air mass was overrun by a warm humid air mass which combined with a strong upper level storm system across west Texas.  the result was widespread freezing rain across all of southwest Arkansas.  The precipitation was a mixture of freezing rain, sleet and some light snow northwest of a Texarkana to Prescott Arkansas line while further east the precipitation was all freezing rain.  Ice accumulations of two to four inches were common.  An estimated 235,000 residents lost electrical power due to ice covered power lines snapping or ice covered trees splitting and falling across the lines.  The was the worst storm in the history of the power companies suppling the power as far as damage but not total ice accumulations.  A total of 29 transmission lines atop "H" shaped steel towers were snapped due to the weight of the ice.  Numerous traffic accidents were also reported and many homes suffered damage from fallen trees and tree limbs.  As a result, the Governor of Arkansas declared a State of Emergency for all of southwest Arkansas. Cleanup costs along reached upwards of 15 million dollars.  Several Pine Plantations throughout southwest Arkansas suffered catastrophic damage from the ice storm with upwards of 25 million dollars worth of young trees destroyed.    
381502	2000-12-24	ICE STORM	AR	0	0	1.65e+08	0	After trying to recover from an ice storm two week earlier in the month, another even more devastating ice storm struck all of southwest Arkansas.  Freezing rain resulted in ice accumulations ranging from 1/4 inch to as much as 6 inches.  After taking a tour of the state, the Governor of Arkansas used words such as apocalyptic and cataclysmic to describe the damage.  Power was knocked out across all of southwest Arkansas with nearly 300,000 homes and business without power due to thousands of trees and 2500 power poles either broken or toppled.  Utility crews from 23 different states were summoned to help repair lines.  Some residents were without power as late as the middle of January 2001.   
381995	2000-09-29	WILD/FOREST FIRE	CA	0	0	5.47e+08	0	A wildfire ignited five miles west of Red Bluff and strong winds and steep terrain made containment efforts difficult.  Five out-buildings and one radio vault were destroyed and 8284 acres were burned before the fire was finally contained in early October.
384125	2000-10-03	FLOOD	FL	0	0	4.5e+08	5e+08	On October 2 and 3, 2000 a broad area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico off the southwest Florida coast moved northeast across central florida and eventually became subtropical depression number 1 then tropical storm Leslie off of the northeast Florida coast.  A band of heavy rain along its southern flank became nearly stationary across southeast Florida and produced a 10-mile wide swath of 10 to 20 inches of rain in Miami-Dade and extreme southeast Broward counties.  The swath was centered from Golden Beach to Opa Locka to Miami Springs to Sweetwater to West Kendall.  About 2 to 3 inches of the rain fell on October 2 and another 12 inches fell during the late afternoon and evening of October 3.  Flooding of  poorly drained urban areas quickly followed during the evening of October 3 and lasted into midday October 4.  Some flood waters lingered for up to a week.   Flood damage was particularly severe in the communities of Sweetwater, West Miami, Hialeah, Opa Locka and  Pembroke Park. An estimated 93000 houses with about 214000 persons were isolated by flood waters.  Power was cut to 13000 people.  There were three indirect deaths including two males who drove vehicles into canals and one man who fell from a roof while reparing a leak.    
384445	2000-06-01	DROUGHT	GA	0	0	0	306720000	Extremely dry conditions continued across north and central Georgia through the month of June. These same dry conditions had persisted for most of the last 2 years. All rainfall was from spotty convective activity, with no widespread general rains occurring during the month.  Most of the convection was concentrated across the southeast parts of WFO Peachtree City's County Warning Area.  The west central and north central portions received only 25 to 50 percent of normal rainfall with northwest and east central portions faring slightly better with 50 to 75 percent of normal.  At the major airports in north and central Georgia, Atlanta reported 1.11 inches, Athens 1.98 inches, Macon 2.86 inches, and Columbus only 0.51 inches of rain for the month of June.  These amounts were 2.45 inches, 1.95 inches, 0.72 inches, and 3.56 inches below normal, respectively.  Yearly rainfall totals for most cooperative observer stations in north and central Georgia were between 10 and 15 inches below normal. The 2 year deficit exceeded 20 inches across much of the same area.  The center for Climate Prediction and the U.S. Department of Agriculture classified most of  central Georgia in an exceptional drought and most of north Georgia in an extreme drought state.  The northern most counties were upgraded from a first stage  drought to a severe drought status.  Water supplies continued to dwindle in most areas.  Streamflows  were at or below the lowest 10th percentile of the historical distribution for June at 90 percent of Georgia's observing sites.  Twenty-nine percent of Georgia's cotton crop was rated in a poor to very poor condition.  University of Georgia cumulative crop damage estimates for the whole state were placed at $689 million dollars, plus another $50 million dollars in increased irrigation costs, for a total estimate of $739 million in losses statewide.  Of that total, over $309 million was estimated for the counties in the Peachtree City CWA. Of those counties, Sumter county suffered the most with over $20 million,  and Dooly county had almost $16.5 million in losses.
388234	2000-08-14	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	0	150080000	The entire summer was nip and tuck with precipitation because of the dry conditions that were in place during the beginning of the growing season.  Timely rainfall during the end of May into the first part of July helped the states crops get off to a good start.  Warmer than normal temperatures set in during the month of August, while at the same time rainfall tapered off.  Crops were under stress through most of the month.  Soil moisture was quite lacking during the last half of the month.  The final few days of August brought very warm to hot conditions to the state as temperatures soared into the mid 90s to low 100s.  Fortunately, dew point temperatures held in the 70s for the most part, reducing crop stress.  The down side of the high dew point temperatures was the increased stress on livestock.  Even the effects of water application were reduced by the high humidity.  By the end of the month, some livestock succumbed to the heat and the states row crops were damaged over the south half of the state.  By the end of the month, agricultural damage was somewhere in the area of $150,000,000 statewide.
388252	2000-09-01	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	0	160960000	Drought conditions that began the previous month became acute during the first part of September, especially during the first three days of the month.  Temperatures soared to between 95 and 105 over the south half of the state.  Once again, high dew point temperatures did help relieve some of the stress on the row crops, but made it more difficult to cool livestock.  Crops dried out quickly with numerous areas across the south half of the state reporting premature death in the corn, and pot abortion with the soybeans.  Significantly cooler weather overspread the state after the 4th.  Along with the cooler weather, came dew point temperatures in the 40s.  by the 6th, significant damage had been done and for all intents and purposes the growing season had ended.  Overall, estimates place losses around 20% of the corn and soybean crop across the south half of the state.  Agricultural damage during the first several days of the month came to about $160,000,000.
392044	2000-12-01	DROUGHT	LA	0	0	0	169600000	The drought of 2000 was devastating to the agricultural community of southwest and central Louisiana. Around 170 million dollars worth of crop losses occurred between January 1 and December 31 2000. The hardest hit parishes were Vermilion with 35.8 million dollars loss, Avoyelles with 28.9 million dollars, and Saint Landry with 26.8 million dollars. The primary crops lost were rice and sugarcane. Drought losses were complied by the LSU Agricultual Center.
392053	2000-12-24	ICE STORM	LA	0	0	1.06e+08	0	Some of the northern Parishes in north Louisiana experienced their second ice storm in as many weeks while others who missed out on the first storm experienced widespread icing problems.  Freezing rain accumulations ranged from 1/4 to near 1 inch mainly north of Interstate 20.  The Shreveport - Bossier metroplex were not affected by this second storm but widespread power outages were reported across Minden, Homer, Arcadia, Farmerville, Ruston, and Monroe Louisiana.  50,000 residents lost power due to ice accumulations on power lines and fallen trees and snapped trees limbs broken power lines. 
398999	2000-05-04	WILD/FOREST FIRE	NM	0	0	1.5e+09	0	The hot and dry weather throughout the spring culminated in a series of dastivating wildfires that sorched nearly 90,000 acres of forest and ravaged Los Alamos and the adjacent Los Alamos National Labratory (LANL). Wildfire also threatened eastern areas of  Ruidoso. A prescribed burn which was ignited May 4 on property of the Bandilier National Monument quickly escaped its project area and then was fanned by gusty winds on May 6 and May 7 into a wildfire known as the Cerro Grande Fire. Despite containment efforts on May 8 and May 9, gusty winds and hot temperatures the afternoon and evening of May 10 caused the Cerro Grande Fire to rage into a fast moving fire storm which swept into western Los Alamos and LANL property. Officials had earlier evacuated over 11,000 people from Los Alamos and the Lab. About 250 homes and Lab buildings were lost to the fire. Another 10,000 people, included some already evacuated from Los Alamos, were later evacuated from White Rock as the Cerro Grande Fire threatened to move east May 12 through May 14. The fire which eventually consumed nearly 48,000 acres, abated in cooler and more humid weather about May 17, but  was not fully contained at month's end.  The human caused Cree Fire also intensified and spread quickly on May 7 near Ruidoso destroying about 8,000 acres of forest and over a dozen homes in rural neighborhoods of northeast Ruidoso.  The fire was contained about May 12.
398334	2000-09-01	DROUGHT	NE	0	0	0	2.4e+08	As the 2000 growing season came to a close, south-central Nebraska continued in the grip of the year long drought.  Beginning in the fall of 1999, the combination of above normal temperatures and significantly lower than normal rainfall had given farmers reduced crop yields, placed stress on livestock and literally "dried up" pastures for grazing. Since late 1999, many areas are 5 to 10 inches below the normal rainfall expected during the period.  Two regions particularly hard hit were near the Kansas border around Superior and from north of Grand Island to north of York.  In the Superior area, the 2000 rainfall has been about 12 inches, or roughly half  of the normal amount.  Dry land crops were hardest hit, but irrigated fields also sustained yield loss along with the increased cost of the irrigation.  The per-farm loss is estimated at about $10,000.  Most of the losses were from lower corn and soybean yields, but increased irrigation costs and the loss of pasture and hay was also included.  In fact, producers were granted the opportunity to cut the road sides for hay to offset lost hay needed to feed herds in the winter.  The governor estimated the total effect on the Nebraska economy to be around 1 billion dollars.
398854	2000-08-12	FLOOD	NJ	0	0	166500000	0	A nearly unprecedented thunderstorm with torrential downpour remained nearly stationary for about six hours from 9 a.m. EDT through 3 p.m. EDT on August 12th over the Hamburg Mountains of eastern Sussex County.  Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned.  **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY **** Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.   In Stanhope Borough, the largest singular loss occurred when the Musconetcong River Dam and the Furnace Pond Dam were damaged. The drainage conduit on the Furnace Pond Dam was eroded to three times its normal size when a large concrete chunk broke away. It increased the outflow along the Musconetcong River. The river rose from five feet to twenty feet. The river normally flows underneath the Compac Corporation's building. But the sudden rise ripped away a bank that normally channeled the flow away from the first floor. Instead it flowed straight into the first floor of the building. The water reached six feet high and shifted large amounts of inventory, pushed 2,000 rolls of paper out of the building  and drenched thousands of dollars of equipment. A forty-two inch diameter tree became stuck within the first floor. About 1,800 feet of the parking lot was ripped away. The structural integrity of the building was intact, but all of the company's machinery was damaged. Damage was expected to be in the millions. Production resumed in mid-September. Flood damage also occurred to the nearby Isolatek International Company, but was not as substantial. A few other businesses in Stanhope and Netcong (Morris County) suffered minor damage. The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged.  In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply. It was repaired on Tuesday (the 15th), In Byram Township, the failure of the Seneca Lake Dam led to the destruction of the Tomahawk Lake Dam and the Tomahawk Trail Bridge (near the Sparta border). The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides.  Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover. **** IN MORRIS COUNTY **** In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed. About 150 persons were rescued from flood waters. About 400 persons were evacuated, mainly from locations near Lake Hopatcong and Lake Shawnee. Damage in the county was estimated at 12 million dollars. The hardest hit municipality in Morris County was Jefferson Township. The heaviest rain in the county fell over this township with Doppler Radar storm total estimates of 15 inches. The township suffered flooding from three fronts: Lake Hopatcong, Lake Shawnee and the Rockaway River and its tributaries. Lake Hopatcong rose nearly twelve feet on Saturday (the 12th) to its highest level in 114 years of record. At 6 a.m. EDT on Sunday (the 13th), the lake was 34 inches above the dam that spills into the Musconetcong River (in Roxbury Township). The previous record was set in 1955. The rise in Lake Hopatcong flooded the basements of lakeside homes. Fish were found in the basements. The lake also lifted boats above fixed docks and eventually pulled them under water. Hundreds of docks and dozens of boats were pulled under water. Other boats sunk. Boat lines were cut in the hopes of stopping boats from sinking. Sections of docks, propane tanks and lawn furniture were floating in the lake. The State Police Marine Bureau  in Great Cove was flooded. After the rain ended, a boating ban was placed in effect to prevent damage to boats by the debris and further lakefront home damage from waves. A swimming ban was also in effect due to goose droppings that streamed into the lake, oil escaping from sunken boats and outflow from nearby septic tanks. A boil drinking water advisory was issued by both Jefferson and Roxbury Townships. The Lake Shawnee Dam was badly damaged. The lake engulfed homes, damaged boats and tore off driveways. Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held.  In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township.  Even though the rain was lighter, flooding along the Rockaway River extended downstream from Jefferson Township. In Wharton Borough, the Washington Forge Dam was badly damaged.  The overflow from the dam divided the borough in half. One family along Main Street was rescued and evacuated. Ross Street was damaged. In Dover Township, forty people were evacuated near the Rockaway River. Nine roadways including New Jersey State Route 15 was flooded. Basements were flooded and cars were stuck in flood waters. In Denville Township, five roads were closed on the 13th near the river. Property right along the river was submerged. A canoeist was rescued from the river after it capsized.  The Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 13th. It crested at 5.04 feet at midnight on the 14th and was back within bankfull at 2 a.m. EDT on the 14th. The Rockaway River below the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 13th, crested at 6.59 feet at 1230 p.m. EDT on the 13th and was back within bankfull at 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. The Passaic River at Pine Brook reached its 19 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, crested at 19.24 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 15th and was back within bankfull at Midnight EDT on the 17th. Storm totals on the 12th included 8.46 inches in Berkshire Valley, 6.50 inches in Middle Valley, 5.63 inches in West Wharton, 4.20 inches in Milton, 2.56 inches in Boonton, 1.85 inches in Ironia, 1.82 inches in Chatham, 1.53 inches in Marcella and 1.51 inches in Morris Plains. On Monday the 14th, an additional inch to inch and a half of rain fell across the county. Storm totals included 1.68 inches in Marcella, 1.30 inches in Long Valley and 0.90 inches in Chatham.  **** IN WARREN AND HUNTERDON COUNTIES **** Warren and Hunterdon Counties suffered flooding from two sides. There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge.  Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County). 
404029	2000-08-01	DROUGHT	OK	0	0	0	399840000	An extended period of unusually dry weather began in early August and lasted for 2 months. Many parts of the state did not receive rain in August, with portions of southwest and south central Oklahoma remaining dry for almost 90 days, starting in June. Due largely to Oklahoma's major crops of wheat, cotton, and peanuts, which greatly suffered, total agricultural losses were estimated between 600 million and 1 billion dollars statewide. Seven Oklahoma counties near the Texas border, including Carter, Comanche, Cotton, Jefferson, Love, Marshall, and Tillman, were declared federal disaster areas. Reservior levels were also low across southwest and south central Oklahoma, averaging 50 percent of normal. 
409876	2000-09-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	102300000	Severe drought continued across southeast Texas through September 2000.  The combination of excessive heat and dryness caused many wildfires to burn during the first week of the month including a 4500 acre fire in Liberty County on the 4th and a 1965 acre fire in Trinity County on the 2nd.  Water rationing continued during the first half of the month in several small communities and was briefly instigated in the city of Houston.  Water line breaks and small grass fires were a common problem across southeast Texas, especially at the beginning of the month.  By the end of September, damage estimates for the season to cotton, wheat, and forage crops and increased irrigation reached $102.3 million for southeast Texas. 
410125	2000-11-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	5.15e+08	Average to above average precipitation continued across the South Plains, the extreme southern Panhandle, and the Rolling Plains in November resulting in improving soil moisture conditions during the month.  However, the effects of this year's drought became better understood after year-end agricultural reports were completed.  These reports, compiled by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service at Texas A&M University, indicated that total crop damage across the Texas South Plains area may have been about $515 million due to the drought in 2000.  This figure is based on the total cash value of all crops in 2000, compared to the average of the same figure from 1998 and 1999. Cotton is the dominant crop in this region of the state, and not surprisingly, it accounted for roughly 70 percent ($365 million) of the losses this year.  Significant losses were also suffered in the wheat ($75 million), grain sorghum ($40 million), and corn ($15 million) crops.  Added irrigation costs that were directly related to the drought were estimated at an additional $20 million across the South Plains area this year. 
410368	2000-12-12	ICE STORM	TX	0	0	1.23e+08	0	An artic airmass spilled southward out of the central plains and into the lower Mississippi Valley.  This cold surface airmass was overrun by a warm and humid airmass which combined with a strong upper level storm system across west Texas.  The result was a mixture of freezing rain, sleet and snow north of a Quitman to Linden Texas line, while further south, precipitation was in the form of freezing rain.  Ice accumulations of two to 6 inches were common across the northern third of northeast Texas with accumulations on one to two inches further south.  Over 235,000 people were without power from several hours to several weeks from snapped power lines.  Upwards of 29 transmission lines atop "H" shaped steel towers were snapped due to the weight of the ice.  Numerous traffic accidents were reported from ice covered roads and bridges.  Northeast Texas was declared a disaster area. 
415742	2001-10-11	FLASH FLOOD	AR	0	0	1.2e+08	0	Numerous roads closed from high water.  The county was declared a disaster area due to the washed out roads and bridges.  Nearly 8 inches of rain fell in less than 12 hours. 
422598	2001-08-01	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	0	578850000	In what became a rather tough growing season, drought developed in Iowa during the month of July, and became serious in August.  During the early part of the growing season, excessive rainfall caused significant planting delays across the state.  Once the crop was planted, cool and cloudy weather settled into the state slowing crop maturation.  Once the warm weather finally arrived, rainfall tailed off significantly.  Very little rainfall was reported during the month of July, however crops flourished with the moisture that was available.  During the last half of July, temperatures began to soar into the 90s quite regularly.  Temperatures were in the 90s to around 100 for most of the first 10 to 12 days of August with virtually no rainfall.  Moisture reserves ran out during the critical time of pod filling for the soybeans and at the tasseling for the corn.  Another factor that complicated the situation was the soil moisture profile over central and southwest Iowa.  After two years of drought, rain began falling during the last fall of 2000 and continued into the spring of 2001.  Though soil moisture was replenished in part, a layer of dry soil remained below the moistened layer, preventing root development below the moist layer.  Reports indicate losses estimated between one third and one half in parts of central and southwest Iowa.  A few locations had verifiable corn crop losses approaching 80%.   Overall, losses for the season were closer to the 15% range.  Damage to the corn crop was a little over $350 million, with about $225 million in losses to the soybean crop, and about a two million dollar loss to the oat crop.
428252	2001-07-01	DROUGHT	MI	0	0	0	1.5e+08	An upper level high pressure ridge dominated the weather pattern across southeast Michigan beginning late June and continuing through the month of July. This ridge prevented the development of widespread thunderstorms, and prevented rainfall from moving into the region from the west. While there was occasional isolated thunderstorms, much of the region suffered a pronounced dry spell. The lack of rainfall put a hardship on the area's water supply and measures were taken to curb usage. This included prohibiting outdoor watering in many communities in Macomb, Washtenaw, Genesee, Oakland, and Wayne counties.  During the five week period ending July 28th, Detroit Metro Airport officially reported only 0.32 inches of rainfall. This became Detroits 11th driest month on record. With 1.59 inches, this was Flint's 10th driest month on record. In contrast to July, April through early June saw slightly above normal precipitation. This wet spring delayed planting of crops and resulted in shallower than normal rooting systems for crops already established. By mid summer, however, the upper air pattern changed and rainfall waned. In terms of timing, the drought impacted many summer crops during moisture-sensitive growth stages of greatest water need, leading to moisture stress which peaked by mid August. It was estimated that yields of corn, dry beans and soybeans were 1/3 from normal. Rains returned to the region in mid and late August. Too late, however, to reverse the negative effects from mid summer. At the date of this publishing, an estimate dollar amount of damage to area crops is unknown.
428612	2001-04-01	FLOOD	MN	3	1	2e+08	0	Heavy snowfall during winter remained on the ground through the end of March and then rapidly melted, resulting in river stages close to record levels. Water began to gush through drainage ditches, streams and into the mainstem rivers during midday April 1.  Heavy rain April 7-8 over much of central Minnesota (see corresponding flood entry) prolonged the high water and also added one or two feet to many crests during mid April.  Another period of heavy rain April 22-23 (see corresponding flood entry) caused rivers to crest again in late April and early May; in some cases the crest was higher than the first.  Many rivers remained well above flood stage into mid-May (see May 2001 Storm Data).  The crest at Montevideo on the Minnesota River was the second highest ever, only 1.3 feet lower than in 1997. The crest at Stillwater on the St. Croix River was the second highest crest ever, only 1.8 feet lower than in 1965.  The crest on the Minnesota River at Henderson came within one half foot of its record level that was set in 1965.  The Mississippi River at St. Paul, Hastings, and Red Wing crested at its third highest level ever, lower only than during the floods of 1965 and 1969. Numerous roads and bridges were closed, millions of sandbags used, and approximately 200 homes and businesses were partially submerged with flood waters.  About 100 homes and businesses were damaged beyond repair.  Part of the Marsh Lake Dam southwest of Appleton (Swift County) eroded on April 7, but officials shored it up with 9000 tons of rock and gravel.  Three fatalities were attributed to the flooding.  Two boys (ages 5 and 8) in Olivia (Renville County) were playing on top of melting snow along a deep drainage ditch. They died when the snow collapsed into the drainage ditch with its torrential flow.  The other fatality came when two men drove around a barricade on Highway 101 at Shakopee (Scott County) and drove into the Minnesota River.  One 19 year old man died and the other was injured.
431148	2001-04-10	HAIL	MO	0	0	3e+08	0	The Heavy Precipitation Supercell continued east from St. Charles County and moved into north St. Louis County. The storm will likely go down in history as one of the most damaging hail storms ever in the area. Hail ranged from 1 to nearly 3 inches in diameter. Thousands of homes and automobiles were damaged. Some automobile dealerships lost virtually their entire inventory. At the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Hazelwood, all vehicles (hundreds) parked outside were damaged. In Florissant, a community of close to 70,000 people, it was estimated that almost every home suffered some type of hail damage.  One insurance company reported that they were working on 20,000 vehicle and 18,000 property claims  while another reported 14,600 vehicle and 14,400 property claims.  As of April 18, at least 40,000 insurance claims for vehicles were taken in the St. Louis area alone.  At Lambert St. Louis International Airport, 22 TWA jetliners suffered minor hail damage. The Missouri Air National Guard had at least 10 fighter aircraft severely damaged.

433508	2001-04-10	HAIL	NE	0	1	3e+08	0	A 5 to 15 minute hail storm hit the Omaha, Council Bluffs and Bellevue area causing extensive auto and roof damage.  The hail covered the ground to several inches in some locations with most stones in the 1/2 to 1 1/2 inch range, although some were larger.   From central into downtown Omaha, as the hail fell the visibility was lowered to near zero and the hail drifted like snow and shovels were used to clear some sidewalks.  An elderly Omaha woman was injured with some cuts and bruises from the hail when she was caught outside.   According to State Farm Insurance agents, the storm was the costliest hailstorm in the Omaha area at least since the late 1980's and possibly ever.  State Farm estimated that there would be 100,000 claims in the Omaha Metro area.  Most of the larger hail spared the northwest sections of the Metro area.
433680	2001-04-30	HAIL	NE	0	0	2e+08	0	Two large hail producing thunderstorm cells tracked across the greater Omaha area this day, one across Douglas county and the other across Sarpy  county.  The storm that moved across Douglas county began producing large hail around Yutan, in Saunders county just to the west of the Douglas county line.   The cell tracked across Elkhorn and then hit the western portions of Omaha with hail up to golfball size.  The hail decreased in size to around 3/4 inch by the time the storm reached the eastern parts of the city.  The majority of hail damage from the storm was in a 2 or 3 mile wide west to east strip centered on Blondo Street beginning west of 156th Street in far western Omaha and ending around 40th street in the east central part of the city.  Damage included roof and skylights along with vehicles.  Since the storm occurred in the late evening, and many vehicles were in garages,  vehicle damage was not as severe as what was recorded with the hailstorm that hit Omaha earlier in the month.

444407	2001-06-05	TROPICAL STORM	TX	22	0	5.15e+09	0	Tropical Storm Allison formed in the northwest Gulf of Mexico during the early afternoon of June 5th, 80 miles south of Galveston.  Allison moved northward, making landfall on the west end of Galveston Island between midnight and 1am on the 6th, less than 12 hours after forming.  As Allison moved inland it caused two to three foot tides, which had little impact on the area.  On the evening of the 5th a tornado briefly touched down in Brazoria county causing damage to one home in the Manvel area.  Over the next five days Allison produced record rainfall that led to devastating flooding across Southeast Texas, killing 22 people and damaging over 48,000 homes, 70,000 automobiles and nearly 2000 businesses. The first significant flooding occurred while Allison was still offshore.  A large spiral band with very heavy rainfall moved inland from Galveston to the Houston area, and by mid evening 8 to 12 inch totals were common from northern Galveston county into southern Harris county.  Heavy rain continued over inland portions of Southeast Texas overnight with 3 to 5 inch totals common, as Allison moved inland and weakened. On the morning of June 6th, Allison was downgraded to a tropical depression.  Allison moved north until it was near Lufkin, then made a clockwise loop and began drifting to the southwest.  Before sunrise on June 7th, the center was near Huntsville, and a band of heavy rain moved into Liberty county producing 5 to 10 inches of rain, causing almost a foot of water on Highway 90.  Around the same time another area of thunderstorms developed over the Sugar Land - Stafford areas of Fort Bend and Harris counties, producing another 8 to 12 inches of rain and causing abundant street flooding and water in some homes.  During the day moderate to heavy rain continued over Brazoria, Houston, Liberty, Polk, Trinity and Walker counties resulting in additional reports of flooding. June 8th began with another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall along the immediate coast, causing flooding in southern Brazoria county, central Galveston county and northern Chambers county.  Skies cleared for a few hours, but the rain began again that afternoon over Montgomery county.  Thunderstorms intensified rapidly over southern Montgomery and eastern Harris counties and began to train across the Houston metro area that evening and into June 9th.  Very heavy rainfall was observed for up to 10 hours in some locations, and rainfall rates of 4 inches or more per hour were observed throughout the night.  Flash flooding initiated quite rapidly during rush hour late Friday afternoon.  Widespread street flooding was the initial threat, but the high rainfall amounts forced almost all the major Houston area bayou systems into severe flooding, with some to record levels.  The flooding caused a complete shutdown of downtown Houston, including all major roadways and both major airports for more than 12 hours.  The Texas Medical Center along Brays Bayou sustained severe damage resulting in the complete shutdown of several hospitals and a significant loss of research data.  Twenty-two people lost their lives due to the flash flooding in Harris county on the 8th and 9th. On June 9th the circulation center of the storm gradually made its way toward Palacios.  Before moving offshore, another round of heavy rain developed across southern Harris and extreme northern Galveston counties.  This caused flooding along Clear Creek, putting water in homes in the Friendswood, Webster and League City areas.
443794	2001-05-06	HAIL	TX	0	0	1.2e+08	3e+07	This storm eventually developed into one of the most devastating hail-and-wind storms in the history of Bexar County.  Hail in sizes up to to 4 inches, accompanied at times by winds estimated to be over 60 mph, destroyed roofs of hundreds of homes, and severely damaged hundreds of vehicle bodies, as well as breaking thousands of windows in houses and vehicles.  The damage was reported to have been the worst in the northwestern part of the city, where hail reached at least 4 inches in diameter.  Damages were estimated to reach at least $60,000,000 for homes, and an additional $60,000,000 for cars.  Additional severe thunderstorm winds struck the western part of the county just before 8 pm and destroyed around a dozen power lines along Grissom Road near Culebra.
445666	2001-12-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	4.2e+08	The effects of this year's drought became better understood after year-end agricultural reports were completed.  These reports, compiled by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service at Texas A&M University, indicated that total crop damage due to the drought of 2001 across the Texas South Plains area was about $420 million.  This figure is based on the total cash value of all crops in 2001, compared to the average of the same figure from 1999 to 2000.  Dryland crops were hardest hit by the prolonged hot and dry weather that occurred during the early through middle summer months. Cotton is the dominant crop in this region of the state, and not surprisingly, it accounted for roughly 70 percent ($300 million) of the losses this year.  Significant losses were also suffered in the wheat ($60 million), grain sorghum ($32 million), and corn ($12 million) crops.  Added irrigation costs that were directly related to the drought were estimated at an additional $16 million across the South Plains area this year. 
461212	2002-09-25	TROPICAL STORM	LA	0	0	108630000	0	Tropical Storm Isidore moved steadily northward across the central Gulf of Mexico on September 24 and September 25, 2002 before moving ashore near Grand Isle early on the morning on Thursday, September 26, 2002. The tropical storm moved steadily north across southeast Louisiana and by the afternoon of September 26 was located in central Mississippi downgraded to a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundreds of miles from its center. Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.  Swells from the distant hurricane resulted in rip tides along the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a 41 year old man drowning on the afternoon of Sunday, Sept 22, 2002 at Port Fourchon, Lafouche Parish.     The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm. Tide levels were 4 to 6 feet above normal across much of southeast Louisiana from Grand Isle eastward to the Pearl River. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees across Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, and Orleans Parishes, inundating roadways and flooding some non-elevated structures. Across Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were measured. Low lying areas, roadways and some non-elevated structures in parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas were flooded. St. Tammany Parish was particularly hard hit with storm surge flooding when the Isidore moved north of the area, and the winds shifted to a southwest direction causing water levels to rapidly increase along the north shore  of Lake Pontchartrain on the morning of Thursday, September 26, 2000. The storm surge overtopped or breached a small local levee system in southern portions of Slidell causing water to flood several hundred homes.   Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rain Rainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana.  Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph. A tornado touched down near Golden Meadow, Lafourche Parish, where a couple of sheriff's office patrol cars were damaged along with several storage buildings. The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness reported appoximately 2500 people sought refuge in approximately 40 shelters in the state.  As of late November 2002, the Louisiana State Insurance Department reported that insurance industry has indicated that Tropical Storm Isidore had  resulted in $105 million in insured losses. Approximately 166,200 claims had been filed with private insurance companies. A reliable estimate of uninsured losses had not been determined as of the end of November 2002.    .   
461220	2002-10-02	HURRICANE	LA	0	0	149580000	0	Hurricane Lili, a major hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico, during the daylight hours of October 2, 2002 moved steadily northwest around 15 mph toward the Louisiana coast during the evening hour. The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall.  Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge.  Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion.  Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore.  No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST. Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.   Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas. 
461222	2002-10-03	HURRICANE	LA	0	3	3.68e+08	1.68e+08	Hurricane Lili made landfall the morning of October 3rd near Intracoastal City in Vermilion Parish as a category one hurricane. Over 48,000 claims were filed with FEMA by homeowners who received damage. along the path of Lili, from southwest Louisiana into central Louisiana. Only 3 injuries were reported. One injury in Evangeline Parish at Ville Platte occurred when a policeman on patrol had a tree fall on his vehicle, trapping him inside. He received minor injuries and was treated and released from a local hospital. The other two injuries occurred in Acadia Parish. Two Rayne city employees were moving vehicles to a safer location when a brick facade at the water plant fell on them. Tornadoes and Flash Flood events associated with Lili are listed separately. Property damage estimates were based on insured losses reported to the state government. Crop damage estimates were based on state figures related to sugarcane, soybeans, cotton, and rice losses. Along the coast, storm surge estimates ranged  from around 10 to 12 feet in St. Mary Parish at Burns Point and Cypremort Point, to 4 to 6 feet in Vermilion Parish near Intracoastal City. Top wind gusts were measured at 120 mph at Intracoastal City and 100 mph in Vermilion Parish, and 100 mph at Cypremort Point in St. Mary Parish. Other wind estimates include 80 mph at New Iberia and Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, 70 mph at Iota, 80 mph at Church Point, and 90 mph at Crowley in Acadia Parish, 70 mph at Bunkie in Avoyelles Parish, 70 to 80 mph at Basile, Bayou Chicot, Chataignier, and Mamou in Evangeline Parish, 90 mph at Jennings in Jeff Davis Parish, 80 mph at Youngsville in Lafayette Parish, 70 mph at Alexandria in Rapides Parish, and 80 mph at Eunice in St. Landry Parish.
461610	2002-04-28	TORNADO	MD	1	122	1.14e+08	0	A destructive tornado crossed the county from just north of Rison, through La Plata, to Benedict before moving into Calvert County.   M51PH A massive tornadic storm tore through Central Charles and Calvert Counties between 7 and 8 PM EDT on the 28th.  The tornadoes it produced left a 64 mile path of destruction ranging from F1 to F4 damage.  Five people were killed, 122 were injured, and over $115 million in damage was reported. The tornadoes were spawned from a supercell thunderstorm that crossed the Potomac River from Prince William County.  Up to 10 miles north of the path of the tornado, large hail up to 4.5 inches in diameter fell.  Debris from the tornado was found as far away as southern Delaware.  Wind damage was also reported near the path of the storm. Across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged, 100 homes were destroyed, 143 businesses (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged, and 49 businesses were destroyed.  Countless trees and agricultural buildings were downed along the rural path of the storm.  Three people were killed and at least 120 people were injured countywide, 12 critically.  A 51-year-old man was killed and his wife was critically injured when their house under construction on Hawkins Gate Road, about 5 miles east of La Plata, collapsed.  A 54-year-old man died in his car from an apparent heart attack at the intersection of Route 301 and Route 6 in downtown La Plata.  The third victim, a 72-year-old woman, died of a heart attack in Waldorf after being frightened by the tornado.   The tornado first touched down on the eastern edge of General Smallwood State Park just north of Rison.  It pushed east-southeast and passed just south of Pisgah where it grew to F2 strength.  The tornado moved through Mount Pisgah and damaged homes on Ripley Road between Ripley and Garden Estates.  The twister continued to move east through rural lands south of Hawthorne Road (Route 255) passing just north of the community of Graystone.  Next, it moved through the communities of Habre de Venture, Longmeade, Clamber Hill, Hawthorne Manor, and Hillendale about 3 miles west of downtown La Plata.  The tornado, now F3 strength, hit the western portion of La Plata next, moving directly through the neighborhoods of Valley View, Morgan's Ridge, Quailwood, and Haldane.  The tornado, now F4 strength, continued east into the downtown area where it crossed through the intersection of Route 301 and 6.  Damage was found on either side of Route 6 with the most severe devastation occurring on the south side of the highway.  The downtown business district was nearly wiped out after 65% of the buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  The 125-foot city water tower was also downed.  The tornado continued its trek southeast of the downtown hospital into the northern portion of Clarks Run, across Route 6, and into the community of Ellenwood.  The F4 tornado moved east of La Plata into the southern portion of Brynwood Farm Estates, then east across the Zekiah Swamp.  Several homes at the end of Hawkins Gate Road were completely destroyed, and this was the location of one fatality and numerous injuries.  Next, the tornado crossed Olivers Shop Road just north of the intersection of Route 231.  It continued east through rural lands until it intersected Route 5 at Homeland Drive just south of Hughesville.  East of Homeland Drive, it severely damaged the Girl Scout facility off Scout Camp Road.  The tornado tracked east-southeast toward Benedict, remaining just south of Route 231 and weakening to F2 strength.  It struck Colonial Lane and a home south of Benedict before crossing the river into Calvert County just south of the bridge.   In Calvert County, the tornado first struck the community of Patuxent View just south of Route 231 at F2 strength.  Over half of the homes in this development were damaged.  One home with no foundation or anchoring just east of Patuxent View off Hallowing Point Road was picked up and thrown 80 feet into a culvert.  A 68-year-old man and his 65-year-old wife who were taking shelter in the house were killed.  The twister continued eastward along Sixes Road to the intersection of Adelina Road.  Several homes and barns were damaged.  From there it pushed east through the communities of Boyds Farm, Mutual Estates, and Chippingwood, where it damaged more property.  It crossed Route 2/4 and 765 just north of St. Leonard, downing trees and it went.  Finally, it crossed the Western Shores Estates development at F1 strength before it moved offshore.  Another tornado formed on the Long Beach shoreline just north of Calvert Cliffs Power Plant.  It downed trees before moving offshore. This tornado grew in strength as it crossed the bay and struck Dorchester County on the eastern shore just south of Taylor's Island.  Across the county, 125 homes were damaged and 10 were destroyed, mainly in the Brownsville and Hallowing Point areas.  County officials collected over 300 tons of downed trees and storm debris.
463202	2002-06-10	FLOOD	MN	0	0	2e+08	0	Heavy rainfall on the 9th and 10th produced a record flood on the Roseau River at Roseau.  The NDAWN mesonet site near Roseau measured 4.32 inches of rain, but unofficial reports of 15 to 18 inches of rain were received.  The official cooperative observer in Roseau reported 9.25 inches of rain for June and the official Warroad cooperative observer reported 13.79 inches.  This caused the Roseau River to rise nearly 17 feet and reach a new record stage of 23.3 feet on the 12th.  The city of Roseau struggled to protect against the rising river, but the levels got too high for the city dikes.  The dikes broke, sending water throughout the city of 2500.  The city retreated to try to save the local Polaris plant, hospital, and high school.  Most people were evacuated to the town of Badger, 15 miles west of Roseau.  It was estimated that 90 percent of the total cropland in the county was flooded.  In the city of Roseau, businesses reported $20 million in damages with the total city estimate being nearly $120 million.  The county estimated roughly $11 million in damage to roads and bridges.  Roseau county received a Presidential disaster declaration.
467991	2002-12-01	DROUGHT	NE	0	0	0	4.8e+08	The prolonged drought across central and south-central Nebraska occasionally was classified into the extreme to exceptional category this summer and fall.  Most dry land crops were near a total loss and there was some decreased yield with irrigated crops.
472277	2002-01-30	ICE STORM	OK	0	0	3e+08	0	Freezing rain began across the northwest third of the state during the evening of the 29th with significant accumulations of ice developing shortly after midnight on the 30th. Freezing rain shifted southward during the early morning of the 30th with moderate to occasionally heavy freezing rain occurring in a 50 to 60 mile wide band, extending from north central Oklahoma, near Ponca City and Perry, southwestward toward Enid, Kingfisher, Oklahoma City, Weatherford, Anadarko, and Hobart. In many areas, the freezing rain continued for 12 to 24 hours, with ice accumulations of 1 to 2 inches commonly observed. As the end of the storm neared, freezing rain transitioned to sleet and snow across Harper, Ellis, Woods, and Woodward Counties, with only a brief transition to sleet across central Oklahoma, including areas along and near Interstate 35.  The worst damage resulting from ice accumulations occurred from near Ponca City, Blackwell, Red Rock, Perry, and Stillwater, southwestward through Enid, Canton, Watonga, Hennessey, Kingfisher, and Guthrie, to near Clinton, Weatherford, El Reno, northwest side of Oklahoma City, Edmond, Cordell, Binger, and Minco. The damage was catastrophic in places, with thousands of utility poles brought down by the weight of the ice, along with thousands of trees. Dozens of towns were left completely without power for days, with some residents expected to be without power for weeks. At one point, nearly 250,000 residents were left without power. In addition to several traffic-related fatalities during the storm, partially due to wet roads, an elderly woman died from hypothermia in her home in Hennessey in Kingfisher County, when electricity to her house was knocked out. Total damage across the state is expected be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
485535	2003-05-07	FLASH FLOOD	AL	0	0	1e+09	0	Significant flooding occurred throughout Jefferson County.  Doppler radar estimated up to 12 inches of rain fell across the county in a few hours,  with 5 to 8 inches of the total occurring in just one hour.  Especially hard hit were Leeds,  Brookside,  Cardiff,  Fultondale,  Trussville and Birmingham.  Numerous homes across the county were flooded.  At least 120 roadways were impassable.  Several sewage treatment plants were flooded and minor contamination occurred.  Several roadways had pavement removed and then washed away.  Several bridges were damaged. Two Birmingham schools were damaged from flooding.   All the roadways in Leeds and in Brookside were impassable.  Seventy four mobile homes were damaged in the Irondale Trailer Park.  Trussville reported that many municipal buildings,  police cars,  fire trucks,  utility trucks,  and businesses were damaged. YMCA's Camp Coleman in Trussville had a mudslide that blocked the entrance to the camp. Several bridges in the complex were damaged.  Brookside reported that the city hall and fire department were heavily damaged from the flood waters.  Several area creeks rose to near record levels.  These creeks include Village Creek, Five Mile Creek, and Turkey Creek.  Fast moving water inundated a private school in Birmingham where children were evacuated. Thirteen semi-trailers were washed downstream as Five Mile Creek overflowed.  The water rose higher than the gage itself.  In Graysville, 10 people were rescued from their flooded vehicles and 20 homes were evacuated.  In Fultondale, almost one million dollars of damage occurred to city services.  At least 25 homes and businesses were damaged in Fultondale.  Black Creek Park suffered significant damage to walking trails and ball fields.  In Leeds,  all the roads downtown were temporarily impassable at one point and subsequently closed.  Leeds High School was damaged.  In Gardendale,  several homes were flooded and a bridge was washed out.  In Warrior,  a few homes were flooded and many roads were temporarily impassable.  City Hall suffered minor damage.  In Morris, one manufacturing plant was flooded.  The Town Hall was struck by lightning which caused significant damage to all the electrical systems in the building.  Numerous roads were flooded in Kimberly.  
488002	2003-10-25	WILDFIRE	CA	4	5	696400000	0	Named the Old Fire, this fire was started by an arsonist on October 25. It consumed 91,200 acres before it was fully contained on November 5, 2003. During the month of October, it destroyed 850 houses, 10 commercial buildings, 1460 power poles, 220 electrical transformers, several miles of highway and utility infrastructure. It also damaged another 35 houses. The entire San Bernardino Mountain range was evacuated. An estimated 80,000 people were evacuated during the first day, and this caused a 28 mile long traffic jam on Highway 18. Eventually the foothill communities of Silverwood Lake, South Hesperia, Oak Hills, Summit Valley, Telephone Canyon, and Las Flores were also evacuated. Smoke, ash, and/or flames from the fire severely impacted and/or halted ground, air, and rail transportation into and out of Southwest California several times. Atmospheric conditions preceding it's start and during the first four days were: high temperatures 90 to 100 degrees, relative humidity ranging from 3 percent during the day to 20 percent at night, and predominate north to northeast winds. The condition and loading of the fuels also caused the fire to grow upwind and up slope against 25 to 50 mph winds. On the first day of the fire, it destroyed 400 houses and 10 commercial buildings. By the second day it had merged with the east flank of the Grand Prix Fire. By the third day when the northeast winds were no longer dominate, it burned over the ridge line, through the Cajon Pass, and down the high desert steppe towards Hesperia. On the fourth day, Wednesday Oct. 29th, an increase in southwest flow caused the southeast flank of the fire to grow rapidly towards Big Bear Lake. Wind gusts over 40 mph were measured across the ridges. Moisture increased rapidly over the next several days and light rain fell along the coastal slopes and ridge tops. As the month of October closed, the fire was still active and hooking around the northwest and northeast side of the San Bernardino Mountain range, threatening to burn up the north slope and into the resort communities.

488004	2003-10-25	WILDFIRE	CA	14	90	1.04e+09	6500000	Named the Cedar Fire, this fire was started around sunset on October 25 by a lost hunter. Wind gusts from the northeast over 30 mph began within 2 hours of the fire's start. Atmospheric conditions remained favorable for rapid fire growth for the four days following with  maximum temperatures ranging between 88 and 98, and minimum relative humidity around 15%. During the first 36 hours, the fire grew at a rate of 6000 acres/hour. At one point it had a 45 mile long flaming front and threatened to merge with the Paradise Fire to the north and the Otay Fire to the south. During the month of October, it consumed 275,833 acres and destroyed: 2403 residential, commercial, and industrial buildings; 2725 accessory buildings; 3302 vehicles, travel trailers, boats, and tractors; 500 power poles; and several miles of utility and highway infrastructure. It damaged another 155 residential, commercial, and industrial buildings; 16 accessory buildings; and 11 vehicles, travel trailers, boats, and tractors. Of the acreage consumed, 33,000 were within the city limits of San Diego. Communities affected included: Lake Cuyamaca, Wynola, Pine Hills, Harrison Park, Scripps Ranch, Tierrasanta, San Diego Estates, Poway, Ramona, Santee, Lakeside, Blossom Valley, Pine Valley, Descanso, and Julian. Federal property containing the Miramar Marine Corp Air Station, the Federal Aviation Administration's Air Traffic Control Radar (TRACON) and the National Weather Service's radar (WSR-88D) and upper air inflation shelter was also consumed. Two U.S.N. troop carriers and QualComm Stadium were used as evacuation shelters. Poor air quality and visibility due to the smoke and ash forced the closures of schools and air and ground transportation. East to northeast winds continued to gust near 40 mph until midday October 29 when the Santa Ana wind event ended.  During the next 24 hours, the winds gusted from the opposite direction between 25 and 40 mph. Moisture increased rapidly and light rain and drizzle were observed over much of the fire area. As the month ended the fire was still active.  F17PH, F45OU, M38OU, M50OU, F28OU, M28VE, F54PH, M55VE, F58VE, M63VE, M32VE, F50OU, F42OU, M77OU
488021	2003-11-01	WILDFIRE	CA	2	7	278600000	0	The Old Fire, which began on October 25, was not fully contained until November 5. During the first few days of November, another 2 deaths and 7 injuries occurred and 143 structures were lost. These are in addition to those reported in the October 2003 Storm data for the Old Fire. Light to moderate rain, sleet, and snow fell 11/01 through 11/03 and slowed the fire growth. Rock and mud slides on Highway 18 and 330 hampered access to some areas during these days, but crews were able to complete containment lines by November 5. The fire was still active until mid November. The total cost of fire fighting (October 25 through November 14, 2003) was computed at $42,336,057.   M54OU, M67OU
495112	2003-08-01	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	645150000	0	Dry weather settled in over Iowa during the month.  The last widespread rain occurred on 09 July. With the increasingly dry conditions became a primary concern as the month progressed. An extended period of heat and humidity from the 15th to 25th saw highs into the 90s to over 100 degrees F.  in some locations. By month's end drought indices had worsened to severe to extreme drought across south central Iowa and at least moderate drought over the remainder of the HSA. Waterloo had its driest August on record, Des Moines its 3rd driest and Ottumwa its 8th driest.  A cold front brought only a brief respite from the intense heat, as temperatures rebounded into the 90s to near 100 degrees F. on the 24-26th. Des Moines Airport reached the century mark for the first time since July 29, 1999, reaching 100 F. on the 24th and 101 F.  on the 25th. This was followed by a slow cool down as several pushes of cooler air traversed the state. Unfortunately there was only widely scattered convection across the HSA on the 27th and 28th, providing little significant drought relief.  Light to moderate rainfall on the 31st fell across primarily the southern one half of the HSA, with the heaviest amounts in the southeast. The end of the month saw numerous records approached or established for an all-time record dry August. At Waterloo the 0.08" broke the previous dry August record of 0.37" set in 1955, while Des Moines had it's 3rd driest August ever with 0.31" (driest 0.14" in 1909). Many stations had from 10 to 25 percent of normal rainfall.  The  drought in south central Iowa as shown by the Palmer Drought Index reached the Extreme category (-4.09) for the first time in this event by August 30th. Statewide NWS Cooperative station data compiled by the Iowa State Climatologist's office showed August temperatures averaged 74.3 F. or 3.0 degrees above the 30-year (1971-2000) mean, ranking as the 18th warmest in 131 years. Precipitation statewide was 0.96" or 3.23" below than normal, ranking as the driest August on record. For the summer as a whole (June-August) it was the 65th warmest (72.0 F. or 0.4 degrees above normal) and the 18th driest (9.55" or 1.93" below normal). The dry conditions caused deterioration in the states crops.  Estimates place yield reductions of about 10% on the corn crop, or a loss of about $210 million.  Losses on the soybean crop were around 30%, or a loss of about $435 million.  
495113	2003-08-01	DROUGHT	IA	0	0	0	312480000	Dry conditions that began in September 2002 and continued through 2003, manifested into a moderate to severe drought at the start of August 2003 which is a crucial time for soybean development and corn in filling out the ears with large kernels.  The last significant widespread rainfall in Eastern Iowa occurred on July 20th with general rainfalls of around an inch.  According to data from the Iowa State Climatologist, August 2003 was the driest on record with an statewide average of only 0.96 inches of rainfall, which was 3.23 inches below the normal for August.  Hot and humid conditions arrived for the second half of August placing extreme stress on crops that were already suffering from a lack of rainfall.  Earlier predictions of a near record or record harvest fell by the wayside by late August.  Estimates of yield reduction were 10% for the corn crop, or about $85.8 million.  Soybean loses were estimated at 30%, or about $226.7 million. 
499561	2003-09-18	TROPICAL STORM	MD	1	200	530470000	190000	On September 18, 2003, Hurricane Isabel made landfall on the North Carolina Coast. Its huge wind field was already piling water up into the southern Chesapeake Bay. By the time Isabel moved into central Virginia, it had weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm. Isabel's eye tracked well west of the bay, but the storm's 40 to 50 mph sustained winds pushed a bulge of water northward up the bay and its tributaries producing a record storm surge. The Maryland western shore counties of the Chesapeake Bay and along the tidal tributaries of the Potomac, Patuxent, Patapsco and other smaller rivers experience a storm surge reached 5 to 9 feet above normal tides. In many locations, Isabel's surge was higher than the previous record storm known as the Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane of 1933.  For coastal properties below 10 feet MSL exposed to wave action, much damage was wrought. Over 2000 people were evacuated from their homes. Maryland saw 472 homes and buildings destroyed, 3260 with major damage and over 3600 more affected. Extensive damage occurred to Maryland's shoreline which rarely sees storms of this intensity. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation estimates that 43,000 tons of silt and millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus and millions of gallons of raw sewage washed into the bay during Isabel. Water surrounded many of the buildings on the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. The flooding caused $116 million in damage.  FEMA was estimating up to $500 million in total damages to Anne Arundel County from the storm.  In Dundalk (Baltimore County), a 27-year-old man was found drown floating in the flood waters. In Baltimore County alone, $3 million in damage is estimated to have occurred from erosion of the shoreline. Residential areas of Millers Island, Edgemere, North Point, Bowley Quarters and Turners Station were hard hit with more than 400 people being rescued from their homes and over 300 buildings destroyed. Marinas were also destroyed or severely damaged. Water flooded Baltimore's Inner Harbor and Fells Point area causing millions of dollars damage to waterfront property.  The Baltimore Museum of Industry alone received $1.5 million in damage. The two hardest areas hit in Harford County were up the Bush River and the waterfront at Havre de Grace.  About 55 people were evacuated from Abingdon, Edgewood and Perryman along the Bush River and about a dozen people were evacuated in Havre de Grace.  The 12.5 million dollars in damage to Harford County does not include damages sustained to Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Those figures were unavailable at this time.  In Calvert County, 4 to 5 foot waves crashed into the towns of North Beach and Solomons. In North Beach, a house was moved off its foundation. The pier at Solomons Island was lost with the storm surge causing extensive damage to the shoreline. In St Mary's County residents saw 6 foot waves crashing onto shore and some homes were literally flattened. Estimated damage to wharves and piers is 2500 destroyed and 1000 with moderate damage costing $10.25 million. Damage to Point Lookout State Park is $3 million. Damage to "shore revetments" was $53.4 million. Damage to residential property is estimated at $16.95 million and businesses $1.5 million. Most of the damage was from storm surge, but some was from wind. On St. George Island, 20 homes were destroyed and water covered much of the island at high tide for a week. The bridge to the island washed out as early as 3:45 pm on Thursday. Charles County had $2 million in damage to roads. Cobb Island was hit hard with two homes destroyed and others damaged. Other areas hit included Chigger City, Port Tobacco, Woodland Point, Swan Point, and Morgantown. Fifty-two dwellings were flooded with damages estimated at $1.1 million with another $600,000 to commercial property. Prince Georges County had high water on the Patuxent, Potomac and Anacostia River fronts. Much of the shoreline has a good rise protecting it from flooding, but three roads were closed from flooding and some property may also have been impacted. Hurricane Isabel's wind field extended for hundreds of miles from the storm's center. Winds were highest along the Chesapeake Bay and Tidal Potomac where the warm waters and smooth surface helped mix down the strong winds from above and blow onto the coastline. Inland, the air at the surface was relatively cool. Temperatures had been in the 60s during the day and the strongest winds came at night. The high winds came with bands of showers that would mix down to the surface causing streaks of damage that sometimes appeared as though a tornado had moved through instead of a strong narrow ribbon of wind. Wind damage to structures was limited with the greatest damage reported in St. Mary's County where on one property winds blew the roof off a structure. and knocked down 70 trees. Unofficial wind gust readings of up to 110 mph have been reported, but not confirmed. Patuxent Naval Air Base recorded wind gusts to 69 mph at midnight and Quantico Marine Base recorded a wind gust of 78 mph near the same time. Andrews Air Force Base also recorded a wind gust of 69 mph around 1 am EDT. Wind damage to trees in the area was extensive and widespread to the region. Soil moisture was high from previous rains making it easier for trees to uproot.  Also, the trees were still in full canopy which acted like a sail to catch the wind. Trees feel on electrical and utility wires taking out power and phone. Trees fell on roads, cars, and homes.   In Anne Arundel County, 196,000 out of a possible 211,000 customers lost power.  In Baltimore, 220,000 out of a possible 273 customers lost power. Baltimore County was estimating 3189 tons of debris to be hauled from the storm. 118 trees fell on school grounds.  In Baltimore City, 70,000 customers were without power.  Calvert County had 22,400 customers without power.  Charles County had 32,000 customers lose power. Harford County saw 51,600 of its 88,000 customers lose power.  Prince Georges County had nearly 200,000 customers lose power and 5000 tons of debris to haul. There were at least 15 buildings with major damage and 53 more buildings that were affected. St Mary's County had 27,092 customers lose power. While most people had their power back in a week, some locations took up to two weeks.  Many injuries and 3 fatalities occurred from carbon monoxide poisoning from people improperly running generators in their houses. Other injuries were related to chain saws and the clean-up of debris.  Calvert County Hospital said they were seeing an extra 130 patients per day.   M27IW
499831	2003-04-03	ICE STORM	MI	1	2	161110000	0	An arctic frontal boundary moved south of the state by the morning of April 3, 2003. This front dropped temperatures to the freezing mark generally along and north of a Brighton to St Clair Shores line. Then, a series of low pressure systems moved across the front. This allowed very warm and moist air to lift north overtop of the sub-freezing temperatures near the ground. The first wave of precipitation moved across eastern Michigan late in the evening on April 3rd and continued through the morning of April 4th. Thunderstorms brought heavy freezing rain to the area during this time period. Spotter reports indicated up to 3 inches of freezing rain occurred in some places. Sleet was also reported across much of the Saginaw Valley. By the afternoon of April 4th, ice accumulations of one quarter to three quarters of an inch were reported across the area. The Saginaw Valley even had one to two inches of sleet accumulations in addition to the ice. After a break in the precipitation during the afternoon of the 4th, a second round of thunderstorms brought freezing rain and sleet to the area during the evening of April 4th, finally ending early in the morning of April 5th. By the morning of the 5th, ice accumulations ranged from one half to one inch. Sleet had also accumulated up to two inches in and around Flint and the Saginaw Valley. Since the road and ground surfaces were warmed due to very warm weather the later half of March, most of the ice accumulations occurred on elevated surfaces, like trees and power lines.  The ice accumulations led to considerable tree damage and widespread power outages across the entire area. Locations hardest hit, with around an inch of ice reported on the trees, were across northern Oakland County, northern Macomb County, and throughout Lapeer, St Clair, Sanilac and Huron counties. In these areas, the tree damage was so severe that dozens of roads were blocked by trees and damage occurred to hundreds of homes, businesses and automobiles as tree limbs, or in many cases large trees themselves, were brought to the ground under the weight of the ice. It was estimated that 450,000 homes and businesses lost power during the storm. In fact nearly 50,000 people were without power for up to a week as persistent cold temperatures keep the heavy ice on the trees for 4 days after the storm. Crews came from four different states to help local utility companies restore power and remove hundreds of broken tree branches away from power lines. A 74-year old man in Troy (Oakland County) was killed when he was struck in the head by a falling tree branch (direct). Three other people died due to carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of poorly ventilated generators (indirect). Two woman were injured in Orion (Oakland County) when a large tree fell onto the car they were in (direct). Five house fires were said to have started by electrical lines being brought down onto the homes. Hundreds of traffic accidents were reported during the storm as well, most of which were in the Saginaw Valley where sleet had sickened the roadways. An estimated two dozen people were injured in traffic accidents (indirect). A 59-year old Bay county man died when his car slid into a ditch filled with water (indirect). A 47-year old Deerfield Township (Lapeer County) man was also killed when he fell from a 40-foot tall bucket truck trying to trim an ice covered tree limb before it fell onto his house (indirect). Statements were made by several long-time residents that this was the worst ice storm to hit the area since the 1970s.   M73OU
508872	2003-09-17	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	NC	0	0	435600000	14250000	Hurricane Isabel made landfall early in the afternoon on September 18th as a category two hurricane across Core Banks in extreme eastern Carteret county. Isabel moved north northwest near 20 mph across eastern North Carolina during the afternoon. Areas mainly near and east of the storm center experienced significant wind and storm surge effects. Major ocean overwash and beach erosion occurred along the North Carolina Outer Banks where waves up to 20 feet accompanied a 6 to 8 foot storm surge. Almost 350 million dollars in damage occurred in Dare county alone where several thousand homes and businesses, several piers, and sections of Highway 12 were damaged or washed away. Eastern Carteret, eastern Pamlico, southern Craven, Beaufort, and Hyde counties experienced significant storm surge damage with hundreds of homes flooded in most of these counties. The highest storm surges were experienced in the lower reaches of the Neuse River where water levels rose to as high as 10.5 feet at the mouth of Adams Creek. Storm surge values ranged from 6 to 10 feet  across eastern Pamlico county with the highest water levels recorded near Oriental. A 4 to 7 foot storm surge occurred across Core Sound in eastern Carteret county, except water levels rose between 8 and 10 feet along the South River and Big Creek. Storm surge values were around 7 feet in portions of Beaufort county in Washington, and Belhaven. Virtually every business on Main Street in Belhaven was flooded with 2 to 3 feet of water. Storm surges from 2 to 6 feet occurred across Hyde county with the highest water levels recorded in Swan Quarter in the southwest part of the county where hundreds of homes and businesses flooded. Wind damage was more significant across Hyde, Washington, Tyrell, Martin, and the Outer Banks counties where wind gusts of around 100 mph occurred. Hurricane force winds resulted in structural damage to homes. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across these areas resulting in  a loss of electricity for several  weeks in some locations. Hurricane force winds were also experienced in parts of the inland counties of Jones, Craven, and Pitt counties during the afternoon of September 18th where inland hurricane wind warnings had been in effect for 11 hours. Other counties west of the center of the storm experienced wind gusts between 60 and 65 mph.             
511467	2003-05-08	TORNADO	OK	0	45	2.1e+08	0	This is the first segment of a tornado that began in Cleveland County and moved into Oklahoma County before dissipating 2.5 miles south-southeast of Choctaw. The tornado began in the area of Northwest 5th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in Moore, near the Church of Latter Day Saints. Damage intensities increased quickly to F2 and isolated F3 as the tornado, initially narrow, moved east along 5th street. Substantial structural damage in this initial touchdown area was confined to homes on the north side of 5th Street, just east of Santa Fe. Homes on the south side of 5th, and those on 6th Street one block to the north, were relatively undamaged. The damage track then widened quickly to nearly one-fifth of a mile as the tornado turned more to the northeast through residential areas, crossing Markwell Avenue between North 2nd and North 7th Streets. The most significant damage on Markwell, rated F2, was at North 6th Street. Continuing northeast and widening to nearly a quarter of a mile, the tornado crossed Janeway Avenue between Dillon Avenue (south edge) and 12th Street (north edge). Maximum damage on Janeway was to homes near 8th Street, and was rated F2. Damage intensity increased to F3 as the tornado approached 12th Street between Janeway and Interstate 35. A commercial building on the south side of 12th suffered F3 damage, as did several homes on the north side of 12th Street at City Avenue where several homes lost most of their outside walls. Maximum damage intensity on Sunrise Avenue (north of 12th and one block east of City Ave.) was rated strong F2 and consisted mostly of homes being partially or totally unroofed. Several vehicles were tossed into front yards, and in one case nearly into the front of a home. The worst damage produced within the city of Moore was as the tornado approached west sides of Interstate 35, just north of 12th Street. Damage in this area included major damage to two hotels, the First Christian Church, the Young Child Development Center, a Project Headstart building, an office building, and several restaurants. The church, child care center, and office building were leveled. The two hotels, both two-story, had their second floors partially or totally removed by the tornado. At least a half dozen vehicles were tossed in this area, with evidence suggesting that some of them may have traveled 100 yards or more. Had the leveled buildings here shown evidence of better construction, damage might have been rated F4. As it was, damage here was rated strong F3. A southbound moving Greyhound bus was hit by the tornado as it crossed Interstate 35. The bus was carrying twenty-three passengers, some of which chose to disembark to take cover in a ditch while others chose to stay on the bus. The bus rolled several times jostling passengers around the interior. Passengers were trapped between crushed seats and buckled walls while others were left hanging upside down and out broken windows. Of those that hid in the ditch, eleven were injured by flying debris. Eight passengers that stayed on the bus were also injured. Most of the injuries to the passengers were minor. The tornado crossed Interstate 35 0.25 to 0.50 miles north of 12th Street, damaging or destroying several businesses along Broadway, just east of the interstate. Intensity dropped to F2 in this area, but the path width remained close to a quarter of a mile. The tornado continued northeast across south and east parts of the Highland Park residential area, causing F1 and spotty F2 damage. The tornado weakened to F1 intensity and turned slightly to the north-northeast as it crossed Pole Road and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near and just south of Northeast 27th Street. It should be noted that the damage track of this tornado through Moore was nearly parallel to, and generally a quarter of a mile or less south of, the track of the F5 tornado that struck Moore on 3 May 1999. In fact, Highland Park also suffered extensive damage from the May 3rd tornado, but that damage was mainly in the north and west parts of the area. The damage track through Highland Park on 8 May 2003 was roughly two blocks farther south. The tornado crossed Northeast 27th between Pole Road and Eastern Avenue and continued northeast, crossing Eastern at the Lakeside Golf Course, just east of Eastern and straddling the Oklahoma City and Moore city limits. This golf course also took a direct hit from the tornado on 3 May 1999, and from this point northeastward for about one mile, the two tornado tracks overlapped. The tornado, at this point F1, continued northeast from the golf course into an open field just south of Southeast 89th Street, then struck the northwest part of a subdivision just south of 89th Street and west of Bryant Avenue. More than a dozen residences, including duplexes and single-family homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The same northwest part of this subdivision was hit hard on 3 May 1999; many of the homes damaged or destroyed on 8 May had been rebuilt and were less than four years old. This tornado continued into Oklahoma County becoming an F4 and traveling a total of 17.3 miles. Two tornadic supercells produced four tornadoes during the afternoon hours of May 8, 2003. One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.
511468	2003-05-08	TORNADO	OK	0	89	1.6e+08	0	This is the final segment of a tornado that moved east-northeast from Cleveland County, 1.5 miles west-northwest of Moore, into Oklahoma County crossing the county line at Southeast 89th Street. The western edge of the damage path along SE 89th Street was about halfway between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue and the eastern edge of the damage path was just east of Bryant Avenue. As the tornado approached Sunnylane Road, it produced significant damage to a manufacturing and distribution plant just west of Sunnylane along Southeast 85th Street. Six people were in the plant when the tornado struck, but were able to seek shelter in a safe room and nobody was injured at the plant. The manufacturing part of the complex was a large, free-span structure that was destroyed. The adjoining office part of the complex to the south was a brick structure that received significant damage to the exterior walls. To the east of the plant along the east side of Sunnylane Road, a car was flipped over. Between Sunnylane Road and Sooner Road, the tornado traveled through an open area narrowly missing a residential area. But as it crossed Sooner Road, it damaged or destroyed a number of businesses including a convenience store and a bank to the south of Interstate 240. The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Interstate 240 and Southeast 74th Street. Along SE 74th, a number of businesses received significant damage including a storage facility, a boat dealership, a Mary Kay Training Center, and a trucking company. Crossing Air Depot Boulevard, the tornado moved onto the property of the General Motors Corporation Assembly Plant causing significant (F4) damage to the plant. A newly built paint shop sustained the heaviest damage exposing equipment and new production parts to the weather. The body shop, power house, and a couple of cooling tanks also sustained significant damage. The stack of one of the boilers was also sheared off. More than 600 newly assembled sport utility vehicles parked outside the plant were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 100 employee vehicles were also damaged with one compact car being flipped vertically and wedged into the side of the paint shop. Two truck drivers making deliveries to the plant sustained minor injuries. However, the more than one thousand plant employees remained uninjured by moving to shelter well before the tornado struck. The nearby United Auto Workers Union headquarters was also heavily damaged in this area. The tornado moved into the southeast section of Tinker Air Force Base, including the south part of the runway complex. An ammunition storage bunker and a guard shack at the gate near Southeast 59th Street and Douglas Boulevard were heavily damaged. The guards and other personnel were able to seek shelter in an underground shelter. After crossing Douglas Boulevard, the tornado continued to slowly veer to the northeast and damaged homes along Berryman Road. The tornado continued to damage homes and downing trees and power lines. Strong F2 to F3 damage was observed on the west side of Post Road to the south of Southeast 44th Street. A number of homes were significantly damaged or destroyed in the north part of the Kennington neighborhood, which is located southeast of Southeast 44th Street and Post Road. Two homes in the north part of the neighborhood were completely destroyed consistent with F4 damage. One of these was a two story home with no roof or walls remaining. Two cars from the garage of a residence on the west side of Kennington Lane were found about 50 yards to the east. Another home farther east was destroyed, although walls remained intact. Other homes were severely damaged. The tornado continued across SE 44th Street and Interstate 40 and went into a residential area just west of Westminister Road. Homes were damaged on Newey Avenue, Randy Street, and Rowlett Avenue with the most significant damage near the intersection of Randy Street and Rowlett Avenue where house damage consistent with an F3 rating was observed. The tornado was likely a multiple-vortex tornado in this area as some of the damage in this area was inconsistent with a single cyclonic rotation. The tornado crossed Westminister Road and damaged more homes along Burning Oaks Drive. F3 damage occurred to a few homes along Burning Oaks Drive between Westminister and Twisted Oaks Drive. To the northeast, homes in another residential area on Southeast 32nd Street were significantly damaged and a number of large trees were also downed. Damage continued to the northeast crossing Anderson Road and Southeast 29th Street moving into the city of Midwest City. There were no known structures to hit as the tornado traveled northeast from near SE 29th and Anderson Road to Hiwassee Road. Significant tree damage was observed and one structure was damaged (F1) along Hiwassee Road just to the south of Southeast 15th Street. A large number of power poles and large trees were downed along SE 15th Street to the east of Hiwassee. To the north of Southeast 15th Street, the tornado moved into the "Hidden Valley" residential area of the city of Choctaw. The only known injury in Choctaw occurred where a woman suffered a broken leg as one home on Hidden Valley Lane was destroyed (F4). Two homes under construction were also destroyed. The tornado was narrower in this area. Other homes in the neighborhood were damaged along Willow Drive, Hummingbird Drive, and Kingbird Drive. In eastern portions of the neighborhood, significant tree damage continued, although there was no significant structural damage. The tornado turned more to the east-northeast again and crossed Henney Road and approached Choctaw Road near Southeast 10th Street where more homes were damaged. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast and dissipated southwest of Indian Meridian Road and Reno Avenue. This tornado carved a total path of 17.3 miles moving across the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area with the most significant damage (F4) occurring in Oklahoma County. Two tornadic supercells produced four tornadoes during the afternoon hours of May 8, 2003. One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.
519900	2003-12-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	2.4e+08	The long-term drought persisted across the South Plains, extreme southern Texas Panhandle, and Rolling Plains through December.  Very few locations across the region received any rainfall at all during the month and average monthly rainfall amounts from the 37 NWS cooperative stations averaged only 0.01 inches.  Soil moisture conditions remained very dry.  Water supplies from area lakes remained extremely low and conservation capacities of Lake Meredith, Mackenzie Lake, and White River Lake were near record low levels.   The Lubbock International Airport received 8.83 inches of rain during 2003 making it the 2nd driest year on record in the Lubbock area since records began in 1911.  This precipitation amount was 47 percent of the normal average annual rainfall for the area.  Other locations that received notably low precipitation during 2003 included 7.82 inches in Morton (43 percent of normal), 7.91 inches in Muleshoe (48 percent of normal), 9.00 inches in Plainview (45 percent of normal), and 9.29 inches in Levelland (47 percent of normal). Crop damage estimates from across the South Plains, extreme southern Texas Panhandle, and Rolling Plains indicate that an estimated 800,000 bales of cotton were lost due to the drought in 2003.  Most of this damage occurred to dry land crops during July and August. 
521171	2003-09-18	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	VA	2	0	5.06e+08	10920000	Hurricane Isabel was a Category 1 hurricane as it crossed the Wakefield WFO county warning area. Sustained tropical storm force winds with frequent gusts to hurricane force occurred over Eastern Virginia, along and near the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Coastal Waters. Isabel made landfall near Ocracoke Inlet in North Carolina, tracked northwest into central Virginia just west of Richmond, then continued northward into western Pennsylvania. The highest sustained wind speed recorded was 72 mph at Chesapeake Light (CHLV2). Other sustained wind speeds were 69 mph at Gloucester Point (VIMS), 61 mph at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, 58 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station (NGU), 57 mph at Sewells Point, and 55 mph at Oceana Naval Air Station (NTU). The highest gusts recorded were 107 mph at Gwynns Island (Mathews County), 100 mph at Reedville (Middlesex County), 93 mph at Chesapeake Light, 91 mph at Gloucester Point, and 83 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station. Only one confirmed tornado occurred in association with Isabel. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Hampton Roads, with approximately several thousand persons evacuated and housed in numerous shelters across central and eastern Virginia. The unusually large wind field uprooted many thousands of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. Over 2 million customers of Dominion Virginia Power were without electricity. Local electrical cooperatives also reported thousands of customers were without power. Storm surge varied significantly across the region. At Sewells Point, the maximum water level was 7.9 feet above MLLW. This represented a 5 foot storm surge. At Gloucester Point, the water level reached 8.32 feet, representing a 6.4 foot surge. A storm survey indicated a surge around 6.5 feet at Colonial Beach. On the Rappahannock, surge values between 5.5 and 6.0 feet occurred at Tappahannock and downstream near Dunnsville. Even higher surge values were noted up the rivers in eastern Virginia, such as the James, Potomac, York and Rappahannock. Storm surge values around 9 feet were estimated at West Point Virginia. At Richmond City Locks, a more than 8 foot surge was noted, and Smithfield also recorded an 8 foot storm surge. An estimated 8 foot surge also occurred near the intersection of the James and Appomattox Rivers in Hopewell. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 987 mb at Portsmouth Virginia. Isabel will be remembered for the greatest wind and storm surge in the region since Hazel in 1954, and the 1933 Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane. Also, Isabel will be remembered for the most extensive power outages ever in Virginia, and permanent change to the landscape from all the fallen trees and storm surge. Rainfall amounts ranged from 1.5 to 5 inches across eastern, and southeast Virginia. Toano in James City county reported 10.60 inches. Inland flooding due to heavy rainfall occurred over parts of eastern and southeast Virginia. Significant beach erosion occurred across Newport News and Hampton. In Virginia Beach, 15th street fishing pier was significantly damaged, and Buckroe and Lynnhaven Piers were destroyed. Significant erosion was also observed as far north as the middle peninsula and northern neck. In addition, many privately owned piers, as well as some public piers were damaged or destroyed by storm surge and/or wave impacts in this region. Eight deaths can be directly attributed to Isabel in the Wakefield area of responsibility, with 7 in Virginia. There were more than 15 deaths indirectly attributed to the storm.   M53MH, M62VE
525145	2004-09-13	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	AL	0	0	2.5e+09	2.5e+07	Hurricane Ivan affected the region from September 13 through the 16th.  The coastal areas were put under a hurricane watch at 900 PM CST on September 13.  The area was put under a hurricane warning at 300 PM CST on September 14.  The hurricane warning was dropped at 900 AM CST on September 16 and we were put under a tropical storm warning.  The tropical storm warning was dropped at 300 PM CST on September 16.   Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed. Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 51 knots from the north with a peak gust of 65 knots from the north northeast.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind of 61 knots from the east with a gust of 89 knots from the northeast. USS Alabama, located off the Mobile Bay causeway,  peak gust 91 knots (site is more than 100 feet high). Fairhope, peak gust 63 knots.  Semmes, peak gust 51 knots.  Grand Bay, peak gust 62 knots.  WKRG in Mobile, peak gust 64 knots.  Wallace Tunnel in Mobile, peak gust 51 knots. Gulf Shores Airport, sustained winds 73 knots with a peak gust of 100 knots (Doppler on Wheels site).  Fairhope, sustained wind 59 knots with a peak gust of 77 knots (Doppler on wheels).  Some of the winds across Northwest Florida were as follows:  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 76 knots from the southeast with a gust of 93 knots from the southeast.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained wind of 67 knots from the southeast with a peak gust of 87 knots. West Pensacola, peak gust 84 knots.  Pensacola, sustained wind 70 knots with a peak gust of 92 knots (Doppler on wheels).  Pace, sustained wind of 73 knots with a peak gust of 87 knots (Air Products location - about 160 feet high). Escambia county EMA office peak gust 90 knots. Eglin Air Force Base sites; 2 SW of Mary Esther, peak gust 103 knots (200 feet high).  10 S Harold, peak gust 78 knots.  10 N Mary Esther, peak gust 75 knots.  5 NE Seminole, peak gust 75 knots. Some of the lowest sea level pressures were as follows: In Alabama: Fairhope 947.9 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport 964.4 MB.  Brookley Field (Mobile) 956.0 MB.  Semmes 967.5 MB. Dauphin Island 952.7 MB. In Florida: Pensacola Regional Airport 970.2 MB. Pensacola Naval Air Station 965.8 MB. 5 S Harold 981.4 MB. Two day rainfall totals ending at midnight on September 16 were as follows:  In Alabama: Mobile Regional Airport (MOB) 5.56 inches. Coden 6.30 inches. Evergreen 7.25 inches. Alberta 6.85 inches. Semmes 5.00 inches. Daphne 7.5 inches. Andalusia 9.96 inches. 2 S Mobile 9.90 inches. Silverhill 10.16 inches. Robertsdale 9.35 inches. Spanish Fort 8.00 inches.

Eglin Air Force Base (VPS) 7.43 inches. 10 S Mossy Head 8.92 inches. Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county. In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage. The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet. The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet. As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.   Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt. It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.    Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.   Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.   In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm. Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.   Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.
527666	2004-06-09	HAIL	CO	0	0	146500000	0	Severe thunderstorms producing very large hail caused extensive damage across southern sections of the Denver metropolitan area.  Parts of Aurora, Lakewood, Littleton and South Denver incurred much of the damage.  The combined damage to homes and automobiles, not including commercial buildings, was estimated at $146.5 million, making it the 4th costliest insurance disaster in the state's history. 
529299	2004-08-13	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	7	780	5.42e+09	2.85e+08	The collective effects of Hurricane Charley in southwest and west central Florida during August 13th resulted in 8 direct fatalities, 16 indirect fatalities, 792 injuries, eight tornadoes, an eight foot storm surge in Lee County, an estimated $11.2 billion in property damage (estimated to be about twice that of the insured damage), and $460 million in crop damage.  The fast movement of Hurricane Charley limited rain fall totals to 4 to 6 inches along the track of the hurricane's eye wall. River flooding of one to three feet above flood stage was found on area rivers south of Interstate 4.   Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers.  Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward.  The center of Charley crossed the barrier islands of Cayo Costa and Gasparilla Island at 345 PM EDT, then moved up Charlotte Harbor before making landfall at Mangrove Point, just southwest of Punta Gorda, at 435 PM EDT.  By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport. Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.  An estimated 250 people were treated by three different remote medical teams dispatched throughout the county.  In Lee County, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated eight foot storm surge that cut a new pass 300 yards wide across North Captiva Island.  The storm surge was estimated at 4 to 6 feet at Fort Myers Beach, Horseshoe Key, and Port Boca Grand.  Two direct and two indirect deaths were blamed on this hurricane. Sustained winds of 61 mph with gusts to 78 mph were recorded at the Fort Myers Regional Southwest airport. A personal weather station in Fort Myers recorded a wind gust of 95 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed 41% of the homes in Cape Coral, ripped the roof off of the post office in Fort Myers, and lead to 1.9 millions cubic yards of debris in Lee County. There was one direct death attributed to the storm when a tree fell on a person outside smoking. There were three indirect fatalities due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator, a candle burned down a mobile home, and one heart attack.  In DeSoto County the storm shelter at the Civic Center in Arcadia lost one wall and the roof pealed back while 1,200 evacuees were inside.  A wind gust of 104 mph was recorded in Arcadia where the storm  downed a water tower.  The majority of Arcadia's downtown was heavily damaged or destroyed and a mobile home park along State Road 72 was flattened. There was one direct fatality in a tool shed that was destroyed by the wind.  In Sarasota there was one direct fatality a wind gust blew a car off the road and it hit a tree. Downed trees  knocked out power and damaged homes in the eastern part of the county.  In Manatee County an unofficial report of 100 mph was reported in the southeast tip of the county.  Downed trees and power lines in the eastern part of the county forced officials to close the Myakka City Elementary School through August 20th.  The damage total listed was estimated by doubling the insured losses.  The doubling accounted for uninsured losses and damage to the public infrastructure.

529307	2004-08-13	HIGH WIND	FL	1	12	9.29e+08	1.75e+08	The collective effects of Hurricane Charley in southwest and west central Florida during August 13th resulted in 8 direct fatalities, 16 indirect fatalities, 792 injuries, eight tornadoes, an eight foot storm surge in Lee County, an estimated $11.2 billion in property damage (estimated to be about twice that of the insured damage), and $460 million in crop damage.  The fast movement of Hurricane Charley limited rain fall totals to 4 to 6 inches along the track of the hurricane's eye wall. River flooding of one to three feet above flood stage was found on area rivers south of Interstate 4.   In Hardee County there were 6 injuries, zero fatalities, and damage was estimated at $750 million.  A wind gust of 109 mph was recorded in Wauchula.   Approximately 1,400 homes were destroyed and 3,600 homes had minor to major damage.  The storm knocked out the power to the entire county.  Many citrus groves north of Wauchula were severely damaged.  In Highlands County there were reports of severely damaged homes in the Sebring and Avon Park areas.  A radio tower was blown down near Sebring and numerous trees and power lines were downed in the eastern and northern parts of the county.  In Polk County there was one direct fatality and six indirect fatalities. There were six injuries, mostly due to carbon monoxide poisoning from backup generators used after the storm.  Half of the county lost power.  A 50 foot deep sink hole opened up and swallowed a car on State Road 60 east of Bartow.  A wind gust of 64 mph was recorded at the airport in Winter Haven before the instrument stopped working due to a power outage and before the hurricane arrived.  A peak gust of 69 knots (79 mph) was recorded in Haines City.  The Bartow and Lake Wales area were hit the hardest.  In all, 22,994 structures were damaged and 739  were destroyed.  Citrus groves around and south of Lake Wales were severely damaged.  The damage total listed was estimated by doubling the insured losses.  The doubling accounted for uninsured losses and damage to the public infrastructure.  Flood damage was included within these totals because it was not possible to extract the flood damage information from the available data.  M61VE
529311	2004-08-13	HIGH WIND	FL	4	0	1.3e+09	0	Hurricane Charley made landfall over southwest Florida as a category four hurricane with estimated sustained wind speeds of 150 mph. Moving north northeast at about 25 mph Charley crossed central Florida maintaining hurricane intensity through Osceola, Orange, Seminole, and Volusia counties.   In Osceola County, widespread power outages and damage were reported, mostly to roofs, pool enclosures, awnings, weak buildings, and mobile homes.  Much of the damage was due to the  thousands of trees blown down.  The greatest damage occurred in northwest Osceola County as the eye wall passed over the communities of Poinciana, Kissimmee and St. Cloud.  Dozens of planes and numerous hangars were destroyed at Kissimmee airport. The roof was blown off the gymnasium at Poinciana High School. Wind gusts to 65 knots (75 mph) were reported at the Kissimmee airport, but much of the area was subjected to winds similar to the 91 knots (105 mph) reported to the north at Orlando International Airport. Three tornadoes were reported with the hurricane.  One was an F0 tornado associated with the outer rain bands. The other two tornado-like events produced large but narrow areas of blown down trees in the eye wall.   A 32 year old man was killed when his vehicle hit a tree across a road.  In Orange County, similar damage occurred as the eye wall moved north northeast over the Orlando metro area, just east of the Interstate 4 corridor.  A wind gust to  91 knots (105 mph) was reported at Orlando International Airport.  A head-on collision at an intersection where a traffic light was out killed a 48 year old man. A wind gust blew a moving van over on a vehicle killing a 7 year old girl. During cleanup a 37 year old man fell to his death while clearing branches from a tree.  Orlando International and Orlando Executive airports also received extensive damage to planes and hangers. Total estimated damage for the county was $881 million.  In Seminole County Charley continued to maintain hurricane strength as the eye wall moved over most of the county. This resulted in in widespread power outages and damage to roofs, mobile homes, and boats and docks on the St. Johns River. Planes and hangars were also damaged at Sanford airport where winds of 80 knots (92 mph) were recorded. Damage at the airport was estimated at $4 million. No fatalities were reported in the county. Total estimated damage for the county was $47 million.  M32VE, M48VE, F7VE, M32OU
529382	2004-09-04	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	0	0	6.21e+08	9e+07	Hurricane Frances formed from a tropical depression in the deep tropical Atlantic on August 25 about 1400 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and reached hurricane strength on August 26.  Frances became a Category 4 Hurricane on August 28 while about 700 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Frances then moved generally west northwest and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane while crossing the northwest Bahamas.  After stalling for about 12 hours on September 4 in the Florida Straits between Grand Bahama Island and the southeast Florida coast, the center of the nearly 70-mile diameter eye crossed the Florida coast near Sewalls Point, at 1 A.M. EDT, September 5, 2004 with the southern eyewall affecting the extreme northeast portion of Palm Beach County.  Frances moved farther inland just north of Lake Okeechobee and weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the entire Florida Peninsula and exiting into the Gulf of Mexico just north of Tampa late on September 5.  It made a second landfall as a tropical storm in the eastern Florida Panhandle. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred in all six south Florida counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, an NWS instrument on the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee at Port Mayaca, just across the Palm Beach County border, measured a sustained wind of 85 mph.  At West Palm Beach International Airport the highest sustained wind was 64 mph with a peak gust of 82 mph and the lowest observed barometric pressure was 972 mb.  A South Florida Water Management District instrument measured a peak wind gust of 92 mph over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  The estimated peak wind gust in the Palm Beach metro area was 91 mph at Jupiter Inlet with a peak wind gust of 87 mph measured by a C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier.  In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest measured sustained wind was 60 mph with a peak gust of 90 mph.  In Clewiston, a sustained wind of 60 mph with a gust of 80 mph was estimated.  The highest measured sustained wind at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was 41 mph with a peak gust of 55 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 62 mph with a peak gust of 78 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 42 mph and a peak gust of 59 mph at Miami International Airport.  At the Naples Municipal Airport the ASOS measured a maximum sustained wind of 38 mph with a peak gust of 54 mph. A maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 13.56 inches was measured at West Palm Beach International Airport with 10.36 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period.  Unofficial storm-total rainfalls included 9.56 inches at Boynton Beach, 8 inches at Deerfield Beach and 7.18 inches at Hillsboro Canal.  Widespread storm-total amounts of 3 to 5 inches occurred in southeast and interior south Florida with southwest Florida averaging 1 to 3 inches.  Rainfall flooding was mostly minor except for a few locations in Palm Beach County which had up to 3 feet of standing water.  A section of I-95 in Palm Beach County was closed due to a large sinkhole. The maximum storm surge was estimated to have ranged from 2 to 4 feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to 1 to 2 feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to 5 feet above and below normal. Coastal beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and portions of Broward counties and was minor in Miami-Dade and Collier counties. There were no confirmed tornadoes. There were no known direct deaths, but at least 9 people died in the aftermath.  Six of these deaths occurred in Palm Beach County, mainly as the result of vehicle-related accidents or from drownings.  Two vehicle-related deaths were reported in Broward County and one person died in Collier County while clearing debris.  An unknown number of injuries occurred. Property damage at the coast occurred mainly to marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats.  Inland structure damage included 15,000 houses and 2,400 businesses in Palm Beach County.  Wind damage to house roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, screened enclosures and outbuildings occurred over much of southeast Florida including areas near Lake Okeechobee, but was greatest in Palm Beach County. A preliminary damage estimate for Frances in south Florida is $620 million, including $500 million in Palm Beach, $80 million in Broward, and $34 million in Miami-Dade.  Crop damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at an additional $70 million to sugar cane and vegetables and additional heavy losses occurred to nurseries. Florida Power and Light reported power outages occurred to 659,000 customer in Palm Beach, 590,000 in Broward, 423,000 in Miami-Dade, 39,200 in Collier, 2,500 in Hendry and 1,700 in Collier.  An estimated 17,000 persons sought refuge in public shelters in Palm Beach County and nearly 7,000 in Broward County.
529384	2004-09-04	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	0	0	4.83e+09	93200000	The center of category 2 Hurricane Frances reached the Florida east coast near Sewall's Point in Martin County early on September 5th.  Frances was moving to the west northwest at 7 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed the east half of the Florida Peninsula. Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon on the 5th when it was about 50 miles east of Tampa Bay.   In Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties, the slow moving storm produced wind gusts to hurricane strength for about 19 hours, producing an estimated 4.5 billion dollars in damage. Wind gusts well over 100 mph destroyed coastal structures, marinas, and vessels.  Farther inland, hundreds of homes, mobile homes, and businesses were destroyed, and thousands were damaged.  Highest recorded winds for Martin county were 91 knots (105 mph) at Port St. Lucie Inlet. The highest wind gust in St. Lucie County, was 94 knots (108 mph) at Ft. Pierce and in Indian River County, 70 knots ( 81 mph) in Vero Beach.  Brevard and Volusia counties also recorded hours of hurricane force wind gusts from the north side of the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed and damaged, with hundreds of thousands of residences with out power. Brevard was hit with an estimated damage of 90 million dollars. Damage in Volusia County was close to 240 million dollars. Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out.  Highest recorded surface winds gust was 78 knots (90 mph) from Merritt Island Airport, although a wind tower at NASA report gusts to 82 knots (94 mph).  These winds were likely representative of what most of the beach front areas were hit with. Daytona Beach International Airport recorded a wind gust to 65 knots (75 mph) prior to the power outage.   Lowest recorded pressures for Hurricane Frances were, 994.9 mb at Daytona Beach Airport, 995.9 mb at NWS Melbourne, 962.1 at St. Lucie Lock, and 964.7 at Port Mayaca Lock.   Beach errosion was moderate to severe from Cocoa Beach to Ft. Pierce, ranging from 5 to 6 feet from south Brevard County to up to 12 feet near Vero Beach where a large section of a beach road was washed out.  A storm surge of 5.89 feet MSL was recorded at the St. Lucie Lock. A surge near 6 feet occured near Cocoa Beach ranging to near 8 feet around Vero Beach where onshore winds were the strongest.  Radar estimates show as much as 13 inches of rain fell in Volusia County with a range of 6 to 10 inches of rain in the remaining counties. The worst flooding from Hurricane Frances was in Volusia, Seminole, Orange and Osceola counties.  Significant inland flooding was reported in Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and Brevard counties.
529402	2004-09-05	HIGH WIND	FL	0	0	127200000	0	Hurricane Frances made landfall just after midnight on September 5th near Vero Beach as a Category 2 storm. The hurricane continued to move slowly west northwestward across central Florida to near Bartow by 2 pm, and just northeast of Tampa by 8 pm, when it was downgraded to a tropical storm. It then emerged back into the Gulf of Mexico near Hudson shortly before midnight.  Hurricane Frances took almost 24 hours to move through the Florida peninsula.    Frances continued northwestward through the northern gulf of Mexico, making a second landfall on the afternoon of September 6th in the Florida big bend near Tallahassee as a tropical storm.  The damage totals listed were caused by trees downed on homes and overland and river flooding.  In Polk County there were four indirect deaths reported; two were separate incidents of people falling off of a roof while cleaning storm debris and two FEMA contract employees were killed when their aircraft clipped a tower and crashed while they were spraying for mosquitoes due to excessive standing water from Hurricane Frances.  In Highlands County there was one indirect death of a man falling off his roof while cleaning storm debris.  In Sumter County there was one indirect death of a man by carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running inside his home.  The damage total listed was estimated by doubling the insured losses unless otherwise noted.  The doubling accounts for uninsured losses and damage to the public infrastructure.  Flood damage was included within these totals because it was not possible to extract the information from the available data.

529480	2004-09-25	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	0	0	379900000	8700000	The center of category 3 Hurricane Jeanne reached the Florida east coast near Sewall's Point in Martin County shortly after midnight on September 26th.  Remarkably, this is in the same location where Hurricane Frances came ashore on September 5th. Jeanne was moving to the west northwest at 12 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed most of the Florida Peninsula. Jeanne was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon of September 26th when it was about 40 miles northeast of Tampa Bay.  In Volusia County, hurricane force wind gusts began with the rain bands on the north side of Jeanne as they moved on shore. The county, already battered by Hurricane Frances suffered extensive additional damage. Fresh water flooding from local heavy rain, and Flooding of the St. Johns River affected more than 200 residences and business properties. Total damage estimates were near $60 million.  Hurricane winds damaged or destroyed thousands of  homes and businesses. Hundreds of thousands of residences were with out power.  Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out. The highest recorded wind was only 55 knots (63 mph), but wind damage suggest numerous gusts in excess of hurricane strength.  The lowest recorded pressure was 993.6 mb.      In Brevard County, the strongest winds swept across the coast south of Cape Canaveral and the southern coastal communities. Grant, Micco and the south part of Palm Bay were hit much harder than the northern locations. County wide damages were reported at $320 million. Especially hard hit was the mobile home community of Barefoot Bay. A Palm Bay man drowned when his pickup truck ran off a road into a deep flooded ditch. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 79 knots (91 mph) at the NWS Melbourne office. Based on radar information, it is estimated that wind gusts over 100 kts (115 mph) swept across the southern coastal areas. The lowest recorded pressure for the storm was 986.8 mb at Melbourne. Total damage estimates for the county were near $320 million.  Indian River County was hit hard by Jeanne being to the right of the land falling eye. 8,300 residences were damaged or destroyed and over 41,000 residences were damaged. Total wind damage for the county was over $2 billion. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 106 knots (122 mph) at Vero Beach and 101 knots (116 mph) at Sebastian.  The lowest recorded pressure for the county was 965.5 mb at Vero Beach.  The north part of the hurricane eye passed over St. Lucie County producing $1.2 billion in wind damage. The marinas along Ft. Pierce inlet were hit destroying dozens of boats.  A 34 year old man was electrocuted when his truck ran into a power line.  Thousands of homes and business were damaged and destroyed by the wind. Especially hard hit were the dozens of mobile home communities. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 111 knots (128 mph) from a private residence just north of Ft. Pierce inlet. The lowest recorded pressure for the county was 952.9 mb at Ft. Pierce.  The eye of Hurricane Jeanne passed over the community of Sewell' Point in Martin County. Over 180 residences were destroyed with about 4000 residences either damaged or destroyed.  The highest wind speed recorded was 91 kts (105 mph) in Jensen Beach.  No pressure data was recorded for Martin County. Severe beach erosion occurred compounding the damage from Hurricane Frances just 3 weeks earlier.
529481	2004-09-25	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	0	0	3.23e+08	3e+07	Hurricane Jeanne formed from a tropical depression just east of the Leeward Islands on September 13. She moved across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then turned north into the Atlantic and became a hurricane on September 20.  Jeanne made a clockwise loop for three days in the Atlantic north of Hispaniola before moving west northwest. It strengthened to a Category 3 Hurricane while over the northwest Bahamas and then make landfall around 11 P.M., September 25 near the south end of Hutchinson Island, nearly coincident with the landfall point of Hurricane Frances nearly three week before.  The 40-mile diameter eye was not quite as large as Frances, but the southern eyewall again affected northeast Palm Beach County.  After landfall Jeanne initially moved along a track similar to Frances, just north of Lake Okeechobee as it weakened to a tropical storm then it turned to the northwest and moved over the northwest Florida Peninsula. Although slightly smaller and stronger then Hurricane Frances, winds and pressures  over southeast Florida were remarkably similar to Frances.  Unfortunately, the ASOS at West Palm Beach International Airport quit sending data during the height of the hurricane. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred over most of Palm Beach and northeast Glades counties and portions of Broward, Hendry and Collier counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, portions of northern Palm Beach County mostly likely experienced them.  A South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) instrument in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee measured a 15-minute sustained wind of 79 mph with a peak gust of 105 mph.  In metropolitan Palm Beach the highest official sustained wind speed was 60 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph from the C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier. An unofficial peak wind gust of 125 mph was measured in West Palm Beach at the Solid Waste Treatment Plant.   In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest sustained wind measured at a SFWMD instrument was 68 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph. Near Clewiston the highest measured sustained wind was 31 mph with a peak wind gust of 72 mph from a SFWMD instrument.  The highest measured sustained wind in Broward County was 46 mph with a peak wind gust of 67 mph from the ASOS site at Pompano Beach Airpark.  At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport the ASOS site measured a maximum sustained wind of 40 mph with a peak gust of 56 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 49 mph with a peak gust of 59 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 26 mph and gusts to 36 mph at Miami International Airport ASOS.  At the Naples Municipal Airport, the ASOS maximum sustained wind was measured at 33 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph.  The lowest barometric pressure of 960.4 mb was measured at a SFWMD site in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee. A SFWMD gage measured a maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 10.22 inches over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  A SFWMD gage about four miles west of West Palm Beach International Airport measured 9.10 inches with 8.79 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period. At Moore Haven, 5.99 inches of rain was measured.  Widespread storm-total amounts of one to four inches occurred in most of southeast and interior south Florida with Miami-Dade County and Collier County averaging one half to one inch. Mostly minor rainfall flooding was observed except locally severe in Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter and in the farmlands of western Palm Beach County. The estimated maximum storm surge ranged from two to four feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to one to two feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to seven feet above and below normal causing severe flooding of some marinas.  Beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and minor in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. There were no confirmed tornadoes. There were no known direct deaths but four persons died in the aftermath.  An unknown number of injuries occurred.  Property damage from storm surge and winds at the coast occurred to condos, marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats and a few coastal roadways. Inland wind damage to building roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, and outbuildings occurred over mainly over Palm Beach County and portions of eastern Glades and Hendry counties. A preliminary damage estimate for Jeanne in southeast Florida is $330 million, including $260 million in Palm Beach, $50 million in Broward and $10 million in Miami-Dade.  Agricultural  Damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at $30 million. Florida Power and Light reported outages occurred to 591,300 customers in Palm Beach, 165,900 in Broward, 25,100 in Miami-Dade, 5,200 in Collier, 3,000 in Hendry and 1,500 in Glades.

Monthly rainfall totals generally ranged from 4 to 7 inches across south-central and southeast Wisconsin, with some scattered spots in Sauk, Columbia, Dodge, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha Counties picking up 7 to 9.5 inches, or 50 to 100% above normal.  In some cases, stretches of some rivers actually went above flood stage in May, 2004.  Refer to flood and flash flood events in May, 2004, for additional information.  During June, 2004, the high water levels kept much of the low, bottom-land under water near rivers and streams; closed some major state highways; forced water into basements; damaged corn, soy bean, and alfalfa crops; delayed planting of entire fields; washed out gravel road shoulders; or damaged foundations of homes and businesses.  Two flash flood events occurred on June 9th (Columbia and Dodge Co.) - refer to those event narratives for additional information.  In general, the June flooding was the worst since 1993 on a widespread basis, but locally it was the worst in the past 25 to 30 years.  Federal Disaster Declaration 1526 covered all 20 counties in south-central and southeast Wisconsin for storms, tornadoes, and flooding for the period of May 19-July 3, 2004.  All counties qualified for "individual assistance" and "individual assistance & public assistance became available for the counties of Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, Columbia, Dodge, Ozaukee, Jefferson, and Kenosha.  Below is a county-by-county breakdown (keep in mind that flood stage for rivers in these counties is 1 foot above bankfull - ponding of water in lowlands continues at between bankfull and flood stage). Marquette Co:  Minor basement damage to 354 homes, and major basement damage to 17 homes.  Estimated private property damage of $1M.  Total damage to public infrastructure totaled $205,000.  At least 28K acres of farm crop ruined for a crop loss of about $10M. Green Lake Co:  The Fox River at Berlin continued to remain above flood stage for all of June.  The river rose above flood stage of 13 feet on May 25th at 2115 CST, crested at 16.24 feet on June 18th at 0500 CST, 3.24 feet above flood stage (major flooding, new, all-time river stage record).  On July 9th, the river fell below flood stage.  At least 30,000 sand bags were used in Berlin to minimize property damage.  The Fox River at Princeton rose above  flood stage of 9.5 feet on June 10th at 2130 CST, crested at 12.19 feet on June 19th at 0900 CST, 2.69 feet above flood stage (major flooding).  The river fell below flood stage on July 1st.  Consult the July 2004 edition of StormData for more information.  County-wide, minor basment flood damage to 22 homes, and major damage to 9 homes.

564731	2005-07-09	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	AL	0	0	1.2e+08	1e+05	For the narrative of Hurricane Dennis, please see Florida, West Panhandle.  After Dennis moved through Santa Rosa and Escambia counties in Florida it moved across Escambia, Monroe, Clarke and Choctaw counties in southwest Alabama.  Tree damage was reported in all of these counties as well as Conecuh, Washington and Wilcox counties.  Some of the trees fell on structures and damaged them.  By far the worst damage occurred in Escambia and Monroe counties in the Alabama counties.  As was the case in Florida, the cotton crop suffered damage from the heavy rains and high winds.
564962	2005-08-27	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	AL	0	0	1e+09	0	For the fourth time this season, the area was threatened by a tropical event.  Major Hurricane Katrina impacted portions of the area during the day of August 29th.    The storm made landfall over southeast Louisiana around sunrise on August 29.  The center of Katrina tracked north northeast near I-59 across southeast Mississippi.  Katrina had a large eye and the wind field was also very large.  Gusts to hurricane force were felt as far east as the Alabama and Mississippi state line. Wind damage from Katrina decreased as you got farther east of the center of the storm.  However, high storm surge values were observed as far east as Destin in Okaloosa county.  The storm surge with Katrina was one of the highest ever recorded as far east as Mobile Bay.  Coastal counties in Alabama were put under a Hurricane Watch  at 300 PM CST on August 27, then a Hurricane Warning at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The coastal counties in northwest Florida were put under a Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch at 900 PM CST on August 27.  The Hurricane Watch was dropped for the coastal counties in northwest Florida at 900 AM CST on August 29.  The Tropical Storm Warning for northwest Florida was dropped at 300 PM CST on August 29.  The Hurricane Warning for coastal Alabama was changed to a Tropical Storm Warning at 300 PM CST on August 29.  All tropical warnings were dropped for the entire area at 900 PM CST on August 29 as Katrina moved rapidly inland.  An inland Hurricane Warning was issued for southeast Mississippi and parts of southwest Alabama on August 27 and August 28.  All inland tropical warnings were dropped the evening of August 29. Some of the wind reports from across southwest Alabama on August 29 were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 57 knots with a peak gust of 72 knots.  Brookley Field, sustained wind of 58 knots with a peak gust of 73 knots.  Evergreen, sustained wind of 32 knots with a peak gust of 42 knots. Dauphin Island, sustained wind of 64 knots with a peak gust of 89 knots.  USS Alabama, peak gust 90 knots.  Semmes, peak gust of 57 knots.  Fairhope, peak gust 54 knots.  Middle Bay Lighthouse, peak gust of 72 knots. Wind reports across northwest Florida: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 49 knots with a peak gust of 60 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 49 knots with a peak gust 62 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 50 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 33 knots with a peak gust of 46 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  30 knots with a peak gust 44 knots.  Mary Esther, sustained wind of 38 knots with a peak gust of 52 knots.  Wind gusts across southeast Mississippi  were estimated to be between 70 and 80 knots. Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Katrina on August 29 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, 983.4 MB. Brookley, 985.8 MB. Dauphin Island, 986.1 MB. Semmes, 982.7 MB. The highest 48 hour rainfall totals (ending at midnight on August 29). In Alabama: Mobile Regional Airport, 3.80 inches. Semmes, 5.70 inches.  Coden, 7.26 inches.  Thomasville, 3.17 inches. Daphne, 4.97 inches.  In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR), 3.06 inches.  Philpot, 7.80 inches.  Milton, 4.50 inches.  Molino, 5.00 inches. Oak Grove, 6.00 inches.  In Mississippi: Flint Creek Water Park, 8.20 inches. The highest storm tides from Katrina occurred at: Mobile State Docks with 11.45 feet.  USS Alabama with 12.0 feet. Dauphin Island with 6.63 feet. Perdido Pass with 5.81 feet.  Pensacola with 5.37 feet.  Santa  Rosa Sound with 4.10 feet.  Destin with 4.56 feet. Some other estimated values: Bayou La Batre with 11-14 feet.

The surge values in Mobile Bay were among the highest ever recorded for the area.  Over 20 million dollars in damage was done to the Alabama State Docks due to the high surge. Major beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to east of Destin.  The west end of Dauphin Island was completely under water with most of the homes on the west end washed away.  Flash flooding occurred throughout the day as Katrina moved inland.   High winds from Katrina caused significant tree and power line damage to the counties that border the Mississippi and Alabama state line.  Stone and Perry counties in Mississippi received the most damage.  The damage in those two counties resembled the inland damage that hurricane Ivan produced in Alabama last year. Highway 98 in Okaloosa county again had some of the lanes damage due to surge.  I-10 bridge across Pensacola Bay was closed for several hours due to high winds.  The Wallace Tunnel was closed due to high water from the surge.  Most of the businesses on the Causeway over Mobile Bay were damaged or destroyed by the high water.  An oil rig being worked on broke free and floated up Mobile Bay and became lodged underneath the Cochran-Africatown Bridge.  The bridge had to be closed for several hours until it could be inspected for damage.  Several weak tornadoes occurred across the area. No direct deaths were reported with Katrina in southeast Mississippi, southwest Alabama and northwest Florida.
566404	2005-01-07	HEAVY RAIN	CA	0	0	0	1.9e+08	A powerful Pacific storm brought heavy rain, snow, flash flooding, high winds and landslides to Central and Southern California. During the 5 day event, rainfall totals ranged from 3 to 10 inches over coastal areas with up to 32 inches in the mountains. With such copious rainfall, flash flooding was a serious problem across Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. In Santa Barbara county, flash flooding and mudslides closed Gibraltar Road at Mt. Calvary Road, stranding several vehicles, while mudslides inundated 3 homes in Lake Casitas. Across Ventura county, flash flooding and mudslides closed down Creek Road at Hermosa Road. In addition, the Ventura Beach RV Resort was flooded and Highways 1 and 126 were closed due to flooding. Across Los Angeles county, flash flooding killed a homeless man in Elysian Park, flooded a mobile home park in Santa Clarita, closed Highway 1 and caused numerous problems in Palmdale. In the mountains, 4 to 12 feet of snowfall was recorded along with southeast winds between 30 and 50 MPH with higher gusts. Across the Central Coast and in the Salinas River Valley, high winds gusting to 65 MPH knocked down numerous trees and power lines. In La Conchita, a devastating mudslide killed 10 people, destroyed 15 homes and damaged 12 other homes. Overall, damage estimates for the entire series of storms that started December 27th, 2004 and ended on January 11th, 2005 were easily over $200 million with the most damage incurred by agricultural interests in Ventura county.
567206	2005-12-31	FLOOD	CA	0	0	1.04e+08	3e+06	Widespread low-land flooding occurred across Sonoma County with mainstem river gages along the Russian River remaining above flood stage for several days. Devastating flooding occurred near the Russian River in Healdsburg as well as Guerneville. The Petaluma River overflowed its banks as well, as did the Sonoma Creek. Approximately 66 structures were tagged by county officials as significantly damaged in the wake of the flooding. An average of 4 to 6 inches of rain fell over a 24 hour period, 2 days after 1 to 3 inches drenched the same area. The flood continued to affect the area into early January.
567221	2005-12-31	FLOOD	CA	0	0	1.15e+08	32500000	Severe Flooding occurred as the Napa River exceeded flood stage at both St.Helena and in the City of Napa. The Napa Creek in downtown Napa also flooded, damaging the entire business district. City and Parks Department in Napa was hit with $6 million in damage alone. The City of Napa had 600 homes with moderate damage, 150 damaged businesses with costs of at least $70 million. More than 5 inches of rain fell on Napa in less than 24 hours. The flooding continued into the first few days of January 2006.

569065	2005-07-09	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	0	0	1.5e+09	3e+05	For the second time in less than a week, and the third time in two months, the area was threatened by a tropical event.  Major Hurricane Dennis impacted portions of the area during the day and evening of July 10th.    The storm made landfall around 130 PM CST as a category three hurricane near Navarre Beach in Santa Rosa county.  Dennis then moved north northwest across Santa Rosa and northeast Escambia county in Florida.  The weakening storm then moved across the west part of Escambia, the south part of Monroe, the east part of Clarke and the northeast part of Choctaw counties in Alabama.  Dennis had a very small eye and winds around the eyewall of the storm caused significant damage as the storm moved north.  An aerial survey of the damage showed a five to ten mile wide area of destruction, with most of the damage east of the eye of the storm.  As Dennis moved north into Alabama the damage diminished and was confined to a smaller area.  A lot of the damage looked like a giant tornado, except the trees were all facing in the same general direction. Coastal counties across the area from Mobile to Destin were put under a Hurricane Watch at 300 PM CST on July 8, then a Hurricane Warning at 300 AM CST on July 9.  An Inland Hurricane Warning was issued for most of the inland counties in Alabama at 436 PM CST on July 9.  Parts of southeast Mississippi were added to the warning during the early morning hours of July 10.  Most of the warnings were dropped at 900 PM CST on July 10 as Dennis weakened as it moved inland. Some of the wind reports from across northwest Florida on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 66 knots with peak gust of 81 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 39 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 46 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 48 knots, peak gust of 72 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  49 knots, peak gust 64 knots.  Crestview, sustained wind of 37 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Navarre, peak gust of 105 knots.  Pensacola (near airport), peak gust 83 knots.  Destin (near airport), peak gust 70 knots. Pace, peak gust 92 knots.  Pensacola (southeast of airport), peak gust 88 knots.  Some of the wind reports across southwest Alabama on July 10 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 32 knots, peak gust of 42 knots.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind at 42 knots, gust to 57 knots.    Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), peak gust 67 knots.   Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Dennis on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport, 956.6 MB.  Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), 986.1 MB.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, 976.6 MB.  Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), 987.8 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport, 990.5 MB.     The highest 48 hour rainfall totals associated with Hurricane Dennis: In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR) 7.67 inches.  Pace, 6.90 inches.  Milton, 7.01 inches.  Munson, 6.93 inches.  Niceville, 5.15 inches.  In Alabama: Bay Minette, 4.65 inches.   Butler 4.36 inches. The highest storm tides from Dennis occurred at: Pensacola with 5.50 feet.  Santa Rosa Sound with 5.00 feet.  Destin with 4.60 feet.  Perdido Pass with 4.10 feet.  Pace with 3.5 feet.  A storm survey measured 6-6.5 feet on Navarre Beach.  Since the eye of Dennis was very small, the highest surge values were near and just to the right of the eye of the storm.  Some higher surge values occurred well east of Destin before Dennis moved ashore. Major beach erosion occurred from Pensacola Beach to east of Destin.  Minor beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to Orange Beach.  Major flash flooding occurred along and east of the center of Dennis during the afternoon and evening of July 10 across northwest Florida and southwest Alabama.    As Dennis moved inland,  tornado like damage occurred near the eyewall of storm.  Almost every structure located on Navarre Beach suffered some kind of damage.  The structures that were located on the beach front all suffered damage.   The Air Force bases at Eglin and Hurlburt reported over a half billion dollars in damage from Dennis.  Almost 200 homes in northwest Florida reported major damage.  Part of U. S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin in Okaloosa county were again washed out by high water.  The west bound lanes were damaged by the surge but the east bound lanes were okay.  It was also estimated that most of this years cotton crop in northwest Florida was damaged. No direct deaths were reported with Dennis, but three indirect deaths were reported.  Two died from Carbon Monoxide poisoning in Escambia county Florida and one from electrocution in Escambia county Alabama.  All of the deaths were related to the improper use of emergency generators.
569191	2005-08-25	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	6	0	1e+08	4.23e+08	A tropical wave that moved across the Atlantic from near the west coast of Africa eventually spawned the tropical cyclone that became hurricane Katrina.  The tropical wave became a tropical depression near the central Bahamas late on August 22.  The depression moved slowly northwest and became tropical storm Katrina on August 24 near the northwest Bahama Islands then turned west and intensified to a hurricane on August 25, a few hours before making landfall on the southeast Florida Coast. The center of the ragged 25-mile-wide eye of Katrina made landfall around 6:30 PM EDT, Thursday, August 25 near the Broward/Miami-Dade County border then moved toward the southwest across central and southwest Miami-Dade County, passing directly over the National Weather Service (NWS) Office in Sweetwater.  Katrina briefly weakened to a tropical storm before exiting the Florida peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 26 just north of Cape Sable in mainland Monroe County then quickly regained hurricane strength in the southeast Gulf of Mexico.  The distribution of winds and rain near the center of Katrina while passing across the south Florida peninsula were asymmetrical with the strongest winds and heaviest rain located to the south and east of the center. Measurements from reconnaissance aircraft and Miami Doppler Weather Radar estimated maximum sustained winds in Katrina to be 80 mph.  The maximum reported sustained surface wind over the south Florida peninsula was 72 mph measured atop a building at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) on Virginia Key.  This wind value was determined by adjusting the actual wind speed to the standard anemometer height of 10 meters.  This same site recorded an unadjusted peak wind speed of 94 mph.  The anemometer atop the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater measured a sustained wind of 69 mph.  Maximum sustained winds measured at the NWS Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) sites included 60 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 50 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall and 48 mph at Miami International Airport. The maximum ASOS-measured peak wind gusts included 82 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 78 mph at Miami International Airport and 76 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall.  Other unofficial peak wind gust measurements included 97 mph at Homestead General Airport, 92 mph at Port Everglades, 87 mph at the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater, 77 mph at Marco Island, 76 mph at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) on Virginia Key, and 64 mph at Boca Raton Airport.  The minimum pressure measured over the south Florida peninsula was 983.1 millibars at the NWS site in Sweetwater. Rainfall amounts were excessive across portions of south Miami-Dade County causing flooding of structures, vehicles, crop lands and nurseries.  A maximum storm total amount of 16.33 inches, of which 15.10 inches fell in a 24-hour period, was measured by a cooperative observed in Perrine.  Other heavy storm total amounts in south Miami-Dade County included 14.04 inches at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 12.25 inches near Florida City and 11.13 inches near Cutler Ridge.  Most of the remainder of metropolitan Miami-Dade County and all of metropolitan Broward and Palm Beach counties generally received rain amounts of two to four inches.  Rainfall over interior south Florida ranged from one to three inches with mostly less than one inch over coastal Collier County. Mostly minor beach erosion and isolated incidence of coastal flooding were observed.  The maximum storm tide was estimated at three to five feet along the southwest Florida coast in mainland Monroe County.  This caused water damage to several homes, trailers and vehicles at Flamingo in Everglades National Park early on August 26.  Other maximum storm tide values included 3.0 feet at Naples Pier along the southwest coast at 2.1 feet at Virginia Key on the southeast coast. A total of six persons are known to have died directly as a result of the winds and water.  Three of the deaths, all in Broward County, were associated with trees or tree limbs that were blown down, striking people.  The other three deaths, all in Miami-Dade County, were associated with drownings, two on boats and one under unknown circumstances.  In addition at least another six people died from indirect hurricane effects including three from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one in a vehicle accident, one during debris cleanup and one associated with a lack of electricity.  Several people were injured, including five or six related to carbon monoxide poisoning. Total damage in south Florida was estimated at around $100 million.  Between 100 and 200 houses suffered significant damage, mainly in south Miami-Dade due to flooding. Wind damage was mainly to vegetation, signs, and watercraft.  Winds and flooding combined caused an estimated $423 million in losses to agriculture and nurseries.  M54OU, F69OU, M25VE, M45BO, M61BO, M49IW
569288	2005-10-24	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	5	0	1e+10	0	Wilma was a classic October hurricane which struck South Florida as a Category 3 hurricane on October 24th, 2005. Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.    Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb.    Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.      Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours.  Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.   The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami.   In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.   Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes.    One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes. Small swaths of greater damage elsewhere in South Florida have not been attributed to tornadoes, but were instead likely caused by  "mini-swirls", small vortices within the eye wall that have been observed in previous strong hurricanes such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

569291	2005-10-24	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	FL	0	0	1.01e+08	0	Hurricane Wilma made landfall near Cape Romano in Collier County around daybreak on October 24th as a Category 3 hurricane with a 60 mile wide eye wall. Wilma then raced across far southern Florida in five hours and exited into the Atlantic just north of Palm Beach as a Category 2 hurricane.  Wilma produced widespread heavy rains of 4 to 8 inches across the area but unseasonably dry conditions prior to Wilma limited flooding.  Storm surge was not a problem in the Fort Myers area as winds were offshore.  In Lee County...The north part of Hurricane Wilma's eye wall passed along the Lee/Collier county border.  Southern Lee County received widespread minor to isolated moderate damage. A peak wind gust of 87 MPH was reported at the C-MAN station at Big Carlos Pass at 654 AM EDT.  The Regional Southwest airport recorded a peak wind from the north of 79 MPH at 828 AM EDT and Page Field recorded a peak wind of 76 MPH at 812 AM EDT.  An estimated 17,000 claims were made to the insurance industry and and $101 million in insured and uninsured damage was reported to numerous mobile homes, aluminum-sided structures, pool cages, shingles, and thousands of fallen trees, some onto residences and vehicles. Farther north, problems were much less notable with minor damage to poorly constructed structures and mobile homes, and scattered tree, limb, and power line damage. The debris totaled about 200,000 cubic yards, or about 1/10 of the debris left by Hurricane Charley in 2004.  Power was out to about 208,000 customers at the peak of the storm.

577615	2005-08-28	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	LA	0	0	1.693e+10	0	Hurricane Katrina was one of the strongest and most destructive hurricanes on record to impact the coast of the United States.  It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th. Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast. Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..  Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data.  Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT.  The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell.  Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.    Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.

577621	2005-09-23	STORM SURGE	LA	0	0	4.32e+08	0	Hurricane Rita produced extensive storm surge flooding across coastal areas of southern Terrebonne, southern Lafourche, and southern Jefferson Parishes where numerous homes and businesses were flooded.  Some of the most substantial damage occurred in southern Terrebone Parish where storm surge of 5 to 7 feet above normal overtopped or breached local drainage levees inundating many small communities. Newspaper accounts indicated approximately 10,000 structures were flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Lafitte and other coummnities in lower Jefferson Parish also suffered extensive storm surge flooding. Storm surge flooding also occurred in some areas adjacent to Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with many structures being flooded in St. Tammany and Livingston Parishes. Approximately 1500 structures were reported flooded in Livingston Parish as a result of storm surge flooding around Lake Maurepas.  Repaired levees damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August were overtopped or breached along the Industrial Canal in New Orleans resulting in renewed flooding in adjacent portions of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish, although the flooding was much more limited in areal coverage than during Hurricane Katrina.  The highest tide gage reading observed during the storm was 7.34 feet NGVD at Barataria Bay north of Grand Isle at 11 PM CDT on September 23rd and approximately 7.10 feet NGVD on Bayou Grand Caillou at Dulac at 0500 CDT on September 24th. Locally higher storm surge values may have occurred in Terrebonne Parish.

Wind gusts over 110 mph were recorded in Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes. This resulted in numerous trees and power lines downed. In parts of Beauregard, Jeff Davis, and Vermilion Parishes, winds blew over 90 mph. The remainder of southwest Louisiana saw wind gusts in excess of 50 mph. Only one direct fatality has been reported. A man drowned near a sunken shrimping vessel near the Calcasieu ship channel. Estimated damages in southwest Louisiana total near 4 billion dollars, with the bulk of that loss in Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes. Entire towns were destroyed in Cameron Parish, including downtown Cameron, Creole, Holly Beach, and Grand Chenier. An estimated 90 to 95 percent of the homes in the parish were severely damaged or destroyed - over 5000 residences. Storm surge values are estimated around 15 feet in parts of Cameron Parish. The storm surge also moved up the Calcasieu ship channel, flooding portions of Calcasieu Parish, including sections of downtown Lake Charles near the civic center, where the storm surge was estimated between 6 and 8 feet. Storm surge also was a significant problem in Vermilion Parish, which saw locations 10 ft above sea level flooded - including all of Pecan Island, Intracoastal City, and Delcambre. The storm surge extended further east, into Iberia and St. Mary Parishes, where an estimated 5 to 10 ft storm surge damaged homes along and south of Highway 90, especially near Cypremort Point, Burns Point, and Franklin.

580485	2005-09-21	TSTM WIND	MN	1	0	1.3e+08	0	A large storm swept across most of northern Hennepin County, accompanied by large hail and a brief tornado.  An NWS damage survey, spotter reports, video, and radar imagery indicate the storm had a very strong rear flank downdraft which was reported to have been sustained as long as 10 minutes in some locations. The wind and hail were responsible for virtually all damage (see separate reports for the hail), and a tornado was on the ground only briefly in Brooklyn Park (see separate tornado entry for Hennepin County).  Tens of thousands of trees were downed, including some snapped a few feet off the ground.  Many roads were blocked. Some neighborhoods were without power for more than one week, as power crews had a massive number of repairs to make.  At the height of the storm, XCEL Energy estimated over 200,000 customers in the western half of the Twin Cities metropolitan area were without power.  many cities declared a state of emergency.  The property damage report of 130 Million dollars covers all wind and hail reports from this storm in Hennepin County on 9-21-05. In Rogers, part of an apartment complex roof ripped off, and a roof from a nearby home was torn off and blown into another home, where it pushed a wall in.  In Hassan Township, numerous trees were toppled, including some on houses, causing major damage. A garage was torn away from a house, and a construction trailer was destroyed. In Dayton, a barn was destroyed and numerous trees felled.  Champlin also had many trees downed.  A roof was blown off an apartment building in Osseo, and numerous trees were down on homes and businesses.  In Maple Grove, many trees were toppled and windows blown out.  A small transmission line went down along with 100 feeder lines.   New Hope and Golden Valley also had downed trees.  Many trees in Robbinsdale and Crystal were also toppled, especially in the north and northeast parts of Robbinsdale and Crystal. Several hangars at the Crystal airport had metal siding and roofs off.  A gust of 68 mph was measured at the Crystal airport at 1813 CST.  Hundreds of trees were felled in Brooklyn Center, and tile from the roofs of a hotel and restaurant were blown off. Perhaps the most severe damage occurred in Brooklyn Park.  City officials estimated at least 10,000 trees were downed, and a local nursery owner estimated 20,000 trees.  Hundreds of trees landed on houses and businesses.  The roof was partially torn off Signature Design Center.  Over 90% of the city lost power. In Minneapolis, most trees were felled in the northern part of the city, namely the Camden, Shingle Creek, Lind-Bohanon, and Victory neighborhoods.  A 45 year old man in the north part of Minneapolis died after getting out of his car.  He was heading for shelter when a large branch landed on him.  M45UT

581533	2005-08-28	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	MS	0	0	7.35e+09	0	Hurricane Katrina was one of the strongest and most destructive hurricanes on record to impact the coast of the United States.  It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th. Damage across coastal Mississippi was catastrophic.  The storm surge associated with Hurricane Katrina approached or exceeded the surge associated with Hurricane Camille and impacted a much more extensive area.  Almost total destruction was observed along the immediate coast in Hancock and Harrison Counties with storm surge damage extending north along bays and bayous to Interstate 10.  Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by the storm surge. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, signage,  downed tress, and some windows were broken by wind and wind driven debris In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines.  Damage was less extensive in southwest Mississippi.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Mississippi were estimated at 9.8 billion dollars. Uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars across the Gulf Coast. As of late October the following fatality figures were reported in the Mississippi coastal counties; Hancock- 52, Harrison - 83, Jackson - 17. Additional details on fatalities will be given in later updates to storm data. Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  The lowest pressure on the Mississippi coast was estimated to be 928 mb where the hurricane made landfall near the Louisiana Mississippi border. A pressure of 976 mb was recorded at 0951 CDT by a university weather station deployed in Pascagoula, well east of the landfall location.  At approximately the same time, the pressure at the NWS office in Slidell, just to the west of landfall location, recorded a pressure of 934.1 mb at 0938 AM CDT.  The highest wind gusts recorded in Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters were 117 knots (134 mph) at the Pearl River County EOC office in Poplarville and 102 knots (118 mph) at 1000AM CDT by a university wind tower deployed at the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County.  Maximum sustained winds in Mississippi were estimated around 105 knots (121 mph) near the storm's second landfall along the Mississippi and Louisiana border.  Unofficial wind observations before the gage failed included a wind gust of 106 kt, (122 mph) at 0615 CDT by an amateur radio operator in Long Beach and a wind gust of 108 kt (124 mph) at the EOC in Pascagoula.  Most tide gages were destroyed by the storm surge so storm surge was determined primarily by post storm high water mark surveys conducted by FEMA. An estimated storm surge of approximately 23.0 feet occurred at the Hancock County EOC operations area in Waveland, and the high water mark measured on the Jackson County EOC building in Pascagoula was 16.1 feet.  Preliminary estimates of storm surge along the Mississippi Coast include Hancock County 19-25 ft, Harrison County 19-25 feet, Jackson County 17-21 ft. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 10 to 16 inches across coastal and south Mississippi with much lower amounts observed over southwest Mississippi. The highest observed storm total rainfall was 11 inches at Stennis Space Center and near Picayune.

581537	2005-08-29	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	MS	15	104	5.88e+09	1.51e+09	Hurricane Katrina will likely go down as the worst and costliest natural disaster in United States history. The amount of destruction, the cost of damaged property/agriculture and the large loss of life across the affected region has been overwhelming. Catastrophic damage was widespread across a large portion of the Gulf Coast region. The devastation was not only confined to the coastal region, widespread and significant damage occurred well inland up to the Hattiesburg area and northward past Interstate 20. This hurricane has changed life as we know it across the Gulf Coast region which will take many years to return to normal. Hurricane Katrina was a very large and powerful storm which set several unfortunate records. This storm began as Tropical Depression 12 during the late afternoon and evening of August 23rd. The storm slowly moved northwest, became more organized, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm during the late morning of August 24th as it moved across the Central Bahamas. The Tropical Storm continued to become better organized as it moved slowly west toward Southern Florida. Katrina became a Category 1 Hurricane late in the afternoon on August 25th just before moving inland across South Florida. Hurricane Katrina moved south westward across Southern Florida and only slightly weakened to a Tropical Storm for a few hours while over land. Katrina quickly regained Hurricane status as it moved back over water in the southeast Gulf of Mexico. Katrina continued to move to the west-southwest over the southern Gulf and steadily became better organized and more intense. During the very early hours of August 28, Hurricane Katrina under went rapid intensification and became a Category 5 hurricane. By Sunday afternoon, August 28th, Hurricane Katrina reached her maximum intensity. The sustained winds were 175 mph and the lowest central pressure was 902 mb or 26.64 inches of mercury. This incredible low pressure ranked Katrina 4th for the all time lowest pressures in the Atlantic Basin. By this time, the hurricane had made her turn to the north-northwest and set a coarse for Southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina continued northward and made landfall in Southeast Louisiana near Empire around 540 am CDT. The sustained winds were 145 mph and the central pressure was 918 mb or 27.11 inches of mercury. This ranks Katrina as having the 3rd lowest pressure at landfall behind Camille (2nd) and the Labor Day Hurricane (1st). Katrina moved nearly due north across extreme Southeast Louisiana and moved inland again at the mouth of the Pearl River around 905 am CDT. Through the morning and afternoon hours, Katrina steadily moved north and then north-northeast across all of Mississippi. Katrina remained a hurricane as it crossed Interstate 20 near Newton, MS. Katrina was downgraded to a Tropical Storm around 600 pm CDT on Monday, August 29th. The storm continued to move north-northeast across eastern and northeast Mississippi through the evening. The center of the storm passed near Starkville and West Point before exiting the region about 1045 mph CDT Monday, August 29th. Additionally, Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 10 tornadoes. These tornadoes were confined to Central and East-Central Mississippi, mainly Newton, Lauderdale, Leake, Neshoba and Kemper counties. These tornadoes were of F1 and F2 strength, with 8 of the 10 rated as F1. The following are measurements of the strongest winds and lowest pressures measured by area instruments. These data may not represent the strongest winds or lowest readings due to instrument failure or power outages. The 3 strongest wind gusts were recorded at Laurel (110 mph), Hattiesburg (100 mph) and Columbia (81 mph). These readings all occurred before the instruments failed. The 4th strongest wind gust occurred in Starkville (76 mph). The 3 lowest pressures were recorded at Columbia (951 mb), Meridian Naval Air Station (964 mb) and at the NWS Jackson (973.3 mb or 28.74 inches). The observed pressure at the NWS Jackson set the all time record for lowest Sea Level Pressure. The previous record was (28.94 inches) which occurred on August 17, 1969 during Hurricane Camille. The damage from Hurricane Katrina was devastating and widespread. Damage occurred across all of the Jackson forecast area which includes 9 parishes in Northeast Louisiana, 2 counties in Southeast Arkansas and about 2/3 of Central and Southern Mississippi. As widespread as the damage was, the more concentrated and most significant damage occurred across Southeast and East-Central Mississippi. For other areas, especially those west of a Natchez to Yazoo City to Grenada line, damage to trees and power lines was significant and scattered across the landscape. As you move toward Central Mississippi and along Interstate 55 the damage and impacts increase. This portion of the state sustained widespread damage to trees and power lines. Millions of trees were uprooted, snapped or severely damaged. It was the fallen trees that caused just about all of the structural damage and downed power lines across this region. Hundreds of trees fell onto homes causing minor to major damage. These downed trees were responsible for 2 fatalities across Hinds and Warren counties. In each case, a tree fell on a house. Additionally, significant and extensive damage occurred to the Agriculture and Forestry industries of this region. The most devastating damage occurred across Southeast Mississippi, especially south and east of a Columbia to Collins to Laurel line. This region received sustained winds between 60 and 80 mph with gusts ranging from 80 to 120 mph. Wind damage to structures was widespread as many roofs were blown off or partially pealed off. Hundreds of signs were shredded or blown down. Many businesses sustained structural damage as windows were broken, roofs were blown off and walls were collapsed. Millions of trees were uprooted and snapped. Power poles and lines were snapped and taken down from wind and trees. It was the thousands of downed trees which caused the most significant structural damage as these trees fell onto homes and businesses. Ten fatalities were caused by trees falling on homes or on people in Jones county. This region received an enormous blow to the timber industry as a large percentage of trees were blown down or severely damaged. This timber damage will effect this region for decades. Additionally, the combination of the winds and loss of power caused significant losses to the poultry industry and other agricultural industries across this region. As Katrina moved northward, the impact across Central, East-Central and Northeast Mississippi was less, but still widespread and significant. The region east of a Monticello to Brandon to Ackerman line saw millions of trees and power lines blown down. Like the other areas, just about all of the structural damage occurred from fallen trees. Three fatalities occurred across Simpson, Lauderdale and Leake counties. Each of these fatalities was from fallen trees. The agricultural industry again was severely hit across this region with the biggest losses in the timber and poultry industries. The utility companies across the region were severely hit as well. Thousands of power poles and countless miles of power lines were taken down by fallen trees and wind. The power outages across the region were widespread and lasted for a period of a few days to as long as 4 weeks. An example of how widespread the power outages were can be shown from the Jackson Metro area which includes 3 counties, Hinds, Rankin and Madison. The first night, Monday night, the Metro had 97% of the area out of power. The most extensive outages were across the southeast and in rural areas. Here, power took 2-4 weeks to be restored due to the massive amount of damage. The agriculture and forestry industries of the state were severely effected by Hurricane Katrina. The timber industry was hit the hardest with timberland damaged estimated around 1.3 billion dollars. The devastating impact to this industry will be felt for decades. Another particularly hard hit industry was the poultry industry. In the region where the hurricane passed, about 9000 chicken houses exist and hold 20-25 thousand birds apiece. Approximately, 300 of these houses were destroyed and nearly another 2400 were damaged. The combination of lost birds and damaged houses bring damage estimates between 100-120 million dollars. The region's Row Crops were hard hit as well. The main crops in this industry are cotton, rice, corn and soybeans. The damage varied and was dependant on location. The estimated damage is around 100 million dollars. The region's catfish industry was also hard hit. The main damage has come from damaged levees and the loss of power. The power outage and the lack of a way to aerate the ponds has given way to disease and stress-induced conditions to the fish. The estimated damages are around 100 million dollars. Other impacted industries across the region include dairy and cattle (est damage 30 million) and Nursery Plants (est damage 18 million). Hurricane Katrina was responsible for 15 direct fatalities across inland Mississippi and 19 indirect. All the direct deaths, in some way, were attributed to fallen trees. Trees either fell on homes, on vehicles, or on the actual person. The indirect fatalities varied and ranged from heart attacks to heat stress during the days after without power. Damage costs associated with this hurricane will be the highest for any natural disaster in United States history. Preliminary amounts, across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area (CWA), show property damage estimates around 5.9 Billion dollars. Agricultural damage across the region was also extremely high with estimates around 1.5 Billion dollars. The total estimated damage is approximately 7.4 Billion dollars. All of these estimates are extremely preliminary and will likely be adjusted over the coming months.

589555	2005-01-05	ICE STORM	OH	0	0	124900000	0	For the second time in just over two weeks, a devastating and historic winter storm affected Northern Ohio.  Significant ice accumulations occurred over most of the area downing thousands of trees, causing widespread power outages and making travel nearly impossible.  Low pressure over Missouri moved rapidly northeast on January 5th.  This low moved across eastern Ohio early on January 6th and was responsible for producing a prolonged period of freezing rain.  A mixture of rain and snow changed to freezing rain from west to east during the early morning hours of the 5th.  Periods of freezing rain then continued for the remainder of the 5th and through the early morning hours of the 6th.  Temperatures eventually warmed enough during the late morning hours of the 6th to change the freezing rain back to rain.  The hardest hit  locations were west of Interstate 71 along the U.S. Route 30 corridor.  Ice accumulations of greater than three quarters of an inch were reported from Hancock County eastward across Wyandot, Crawford, Richland and Ashland Counties.  Northern sections of Wyandot and Marion Counties along with the southern halves of Seneca and Huron County were also hard hit.  Up to 80 percent of electric customers in these nine counties lost service during the storm, some for as much as ten days.  In cities like Mansfield, Bucyrus and Findlay, nearly every property in some neighborhoods sustained tree damage.  To the north and south of these areas ice accumulations ranged from one quarter to three quarters of an inch.  Counties closer to Lake Erie saw snow mix with the freezing rain at times which kept ice accumulations down to around one quarter inch and resulted in only scattered power outages.  A total of 3 to 5 inches of snow was also reported in these counties.  Ice build up at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant (Ottawa County) damaged the facility enough to force it to be temporarily shut down.  Hundreds of crews were brought in from around the county to help restore the power outages.  In addition to damage caused by fallen trees and limbs, a lot of basement flooding occurred as power outages prevented sump pumps from working.  Clean up and repair costs for this storm were among the highest ever recorded for a natural disaster in Ohio.  Damage in many counties topped $1 million with a couple counties exceeding $10 million in losses.  In Richland County alone, clean up cost accrued by local governments totaled nearly $6 million.  Estimates indicate that as many as one million people lost power during this storm.  Several power companies reported the largest number of outages in their histories.  Hundreds if not thousands of homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, limbs and utility poles.

598472	2005-09-23	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	TX	1	0	2.09e+09	0	Although Hurricane Rita made landfall just east of the Texas - Louisiana border, she moved northwest and moved across southeast Texas in the morning hours of September 24th as a dangerous category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120 mph. Along the coast of Jefferson County, storm surges near 10 feet occurred near Sabine Pass, where over 90 percent of the homes were severely damaged or destroyed. The storm surge backed up the Sabine River, and flooded a small section of downtown Orange with around 4 to 5 feet of storm surge. Winds blew over 100 mph across the entire region, snapping and uprooting trees, and damaged over 125,000 homes and businesses. Some homes in rural Jasper and Newton counties did not have electricity restored for over six weeks. One direct fatality occurred in Jasper County when a tree fell on a mobile home. Six other indirect fatalities occurred in Jefferson County in Beaumont, where a family died of carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator inside their apartment.  M?MH
598473	2005-09-23	HURRICANE/TYPHOON	TX	3	3	159500000	0	The eye of Hurricane Rita moved ashore in extreme southwest Louisiana between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou In Cameron Parish with a minimum central pressure of 937 mb and maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Rita was a Category 3 hurricane at landfall. Two and a half weeks after Hurricane Katrina made her final and devastating landfall along the northern Gulf coast, all eyes turned to Tropical Storm Rita as she moved westward through the central Bahamas. On Tuesday, September 20th, Rita rapidly intensified while moving west through the Florida Straits into the Gulf of Mexico. Rita reached Category 2 intensity as the center passed about 50 miles south of Key West and significantly impacted the Florida Keys.  After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Rita intensified at an astounding rate going from Category 2 to Category 5 intensity in 24 hours. Following this rapid intensification period, sustained winds reached 165 mph on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 21st. Since early Monday, Rita had been consistently forecast to make landfall along the upper southeast Texas coast, when the 120 hour forecast from the National Hurricane Center depicted a landfall near San Luis Pass. Emergency management officials, members of the media, and residents of southeast Texas had been watching Rita closely and planning their course of action on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, even though the hurricane was still 620 miles southeast of Galveston, everyone had the images of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the central Gulf of Mexico coast still fresh in mind, and an unprecedented, largely voluntary evacuation began on Wednesday across southeast Texas. Emergency management officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for coastal sections of southeast Texas beginning at 6 PM on Wednesday. However, residents waiting until then to begin their evacuation found roadways in and around the densely populated Houston/Galveston area already jammed with motorists who had left earlier in the day. The fear of Katrina-like impacts prompted many inland residents to evacuate even though they were not at risk from storm surge flooding. Therefore, an incredible number of people left, with officials estimating the total to be over 2.5 million. Although the gridlock and gasoline shortages frustrated many evacuees, the evacuation had been ordered very early, and there was ample time for residents to escape the region before the onset of adverse conditions, which were expected on Friday afternoon. By early Thursday morning, September 22nd, Rita had strengthened further and reached a peak intensity of 175 mph winds with a minimum central pressure of 897 mbs. This was the third lowest pressure on record at that time for the Atlantic basin, and displaced Katrina to fifth on the most intense hurricane list. An upper-level disturbance passing well north of Katrina early on Thursday briefly induced a more northward motion and altered Rita's motion from west-northwest to northwest. Although this change in motion was only slight; it spared the densely populated Houston/Galveston area from a direct hit and shifted the forecast track and eventual landfall point to the right. Residents of extreme southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana were then expected to experience the brunt of Rita. Fortunately, Rita weakened to a Category 3 hurricane on Friday, September 23rd, prior to landfall which occurred around 2:30 AM Saturday morning just east of the Texas/Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou. Rita caused devastating storm surge flooding and wind damage in southwest Louisiana and extreme southeast Texas.  Hurricane Rita was the strongest hurricane to make landfall across this portion of the U.S. coastline since Hurricane Audrey (1957). Rita affected a large inland area from southeast Texas across southwest and into south-central Louisiana. Widespread damage consisting of downed trees and power lines occurred generally along and east of a line from Crystal Beach to Liberty to Livingston to Lufkin in Texas. Although Rita tracked 50 miles east of Lake Livingston, sustained northerly winds of 40 to 60 mph occurred across the lake, generating a lake surge that damaged the dam. Fear that the dam could break forced an evacuation of communities immediately downstream as a precautionary measure. Emergency water releases from the dam on Saturday quickly abated this danger. Moderate beach erosion occurred from Freeport to High Island. Dunes protecting many beach houses along the west end of Galveston Island and Surfside in Brazoria County were washed away. Large geotubes along portions of the west end of Galveston Island and also along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula did reduce erosion in areas where they were installed. Most flooding was due to high tides along Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. Most of this flooding actually occurred near the time of landfall as water in Galveston Bay was pushed south out of the Bay onto the north facing shores of the island and the peninsula. Tides remained high on Saturday (after Rita made landfall) as strong westerly winds pushed water into East Bay. No significant flooding occurred due to heavy rain. All of the associated effects of Hurricane Rita in southeast Texas resulted in 3 direct fatalities, 3 injuries and $159.5 million in property and crop damage. In addition, the massive evacuation resulted in at least 49 indirect fatalities, mostly due to excessive heat and the transportation of the elderly out of harm's way.  In Harris County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 60 mph caused numerous trees to be blown down resulting in widespread power outages that lasted for six days in some areas. Roof, fence, sign, and glass damage estimates was around $90 million. The greatest loss was to inventory spoilage of food due to power outages. There were at least 34 indirect fatalities before, during and after Hurricane Rita. The majority of these fatalities occurred during the evacuation prior to Rita and were the result of excessive heat and transporting the elderly.  In Brazoria County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph caused some tree damage and power outages for a couple of days. Minor damage was reported in Surfside to roads and a few homes. Total damage was around $500,000. In Montgomery County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $2.5 million. There were 13 indirect fatalities. Ten of the deaths were evacuation related while 3 deaths were carbon monoxide poisoning with no electricity in the home. In Walker County, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Damage was mainly to fences, roofs, and mobile homes and totaled approximately $1.5 million.    In Galveston County, tropical storm force sustained winds with gusts to hurricane force were reported across the county, especially on the Bolivar Peninsula. Numerous power poles and road signs were blown down on Bolivar. Many of the beach homes received roof damage. Numerous trees were down with small structure damage on High Island. Power was out to most of the county on Saturday. In Galveston's historic district, a large brick-covered side of a three-story building collapsed and three other buildings caught fire and were destroyed during the height of the storm. There were three directly related injuries. A thirty-year-old woman suffered severe burns in the fire and two firefighters had minor injuries. Small structure, dock, and pier damage along with downed power lines occurred across Galveston Island. Total damage across the county was around $15 million. In Chambers County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. One frame building near Winnie received major damage. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $8 million. One indirect fatality occurred in the county. In Liberty County, tropical storm force winds with gusts in excess of hurricane force were observed. Damage consisted of downed trees, destroyed metal buildings and awnings, and downed power poles. Power was out throughout the county for up to seven days. Total damage across the county was around $7 million. There were two direct fatalities. In Hardin, a man and a woman were killed when a tree fell on the home they were sleeping in.  In Polk and San Jacinto Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force were observed. Widespread trees were down with many trees taking down power lines. Some trees fell onto homes and caused considerable damage. Widespread power outages were observed across both counties. Lake Livingston Dam reported a wind gust of 117 mph around 5:30 AM Saturday morning. This wind sensor was on the dam and the wind was blowing across the lake. With the reduced friction across the lake's surface, this wind gust report is reasonable. The strong wind blowing along the lake created a storm surge of approximately 1.5 feet at the dam. This high water and the wave action damaged the dam which required emergency releases from the lake to stabilize the dam. The damage in Polk County was around $23 million with $20 million of that being damage to the dam at Lake Livingston. Damage in San Jacinto County was estimated at $10 million. There was one direct fatality in San Jacinto County. A three-year-old female was killed instantly by a tree falling on to her home in Point Blank.  In Houston and Trinity Counties, tropical storm force winds with gusts to near 50 mph were observed. Numerous trees were down resulting in numerous power outages. One heat related indirect death occurred in Houston County during the evacuation. Total damage for both Houston and Trinity counties was near $2 million. No tornadoes were reported with Rita. Maximum rainfall amounts with Rita were between 4 and 6 inches in and around the New Caney area of Montgomery County.  M43PH, F56PH, F3PH
598619	2005-11-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	1.2e+08	Drought conditions worsened across north Texas in November.  The regions of east and north Texas considered to be in severe drought (D2) as classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor continued to expand.  An area of extreme drought (D3), which returned to the area in October, expanded to encompass a roughly twenty-four thousand square mile area, including the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.   The average high temperature for the month was 7.7 degrees above normal.  Rain was only measured one day at Dallas/Fort Worth...a meager 0.02 inches.  The period from September through November this year ranked as the driest fall on record for Waco, during which only 1.46 inches of rain fell.  It was the 4th driest fall on record for Dallas/Fort Worth, with only 2.25 inches of rainfall.  Both hydrological and agricultural impacts were noted in the Drought Impact Reporter this month.  Several grass fires broke out in north Texas in the last few days of November, destroying over twenty homes.  Low humidities and high winds accelerated grass fires in six north Texas counties on the 27th.  Similar conditions on the 28th made it difficult for firefighters battling fires for a second day.  The fires destroyed homes, forced hundreds to evacuate, and injured firefighters.  One fire began west of Cleburne in Johnson County and spread into Tarrant County, burning 1,000 acres and twenty-four structures, according to the Johnson County Sheriff's Department.    Significant agricultural impacts became more widespread this month as the drought worsened.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared five counties in Texas natural disaster areas, including Fannin, Grayson, Collin, Delta, Lamar, and Hunt.  Texas Governor Rick Perry also requested assistance for six other north central Texas counties (Coryell, Henderson, Johnson, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Van Zandt) due to worsening drought conditions.  According to the Drought Impact Reporter, Texas agriculture officials noted mounting losses from the 2005 drought in the eastern two-thirds of the state, especially in the livestock sector.  Sales of cattle normally account for about half of the cash receipts in the state.  The Texas Agricultural Statistics Service stated that market prices were lower for calves this fall, causing many ranchers to sell lighter calves and take lower prices because there was not enough grazing for the winter.  Farm Services Agency statistics indicated non-irrigated forage grazing losses of 77% in Grayson County.  Only about half of the 2005 hay crop was harvested, and many farmers were unable to harvest second and third cuttings, causing hay prices to increase sharply.  Many producers had to haul water to pastures because stock tanks dried up.  In addition, most of the one million acres of wheat planted this year in drought-affected areas did not come up.  Fall-planted grains such as oats and rye, used for winter grazing, were similarly affected.   The drought continued into December. 
598660	2005-12-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	1.2e+08	Devastating drought conditions continued through December.  The area of extreme drought (D3) as classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor expanded to include roughly the northeast quarter of the state of Texas.  For the first time since the drought began in May, an area of exceptional drought (D4) was introduced into the Drought Monitor.  This is the most severe classification of drought and included a large area of north Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  Dallas/Fort Worth ended the year at 15.76 inches below normal, while Waco was 10.09 inches below normal, making this the worst drought in north Texas since the 1950s.  Collin, Delta, Fannin, Hopkins, Lamar, and Rains Counties were declared natural disaster areas due to extreme drought conditions.  Requests for disaster drought declarations were also pending for numerous other north Texas counties. Wildfires were a significant threat across north Texas in December.  A combination of warm dry conditions, strong winds, dormant vegetation, and continuing drought created favorable conditions for the fires, which authorities believe were started primarily by people ignoring fire bans, burning trash, shooting fireworks, and throwing out cigarettes.  The Texas Interagency Coordination Center reported that federal, state, and local fire crews fought 13 fires over 879 acres in Texas on December 18 alone.  Through December 22, the state recorded a total of 676 fires involving 30,441 acres.  Governor Rick Perry asked for federal disaster declarations after several dozen fires burned on December 27-28.  According to the state emergency management agency, fires on Dec. 27-28 destroyed more than 100 buildings across Texas, including 78 homes.  Because of widespread drought conditions, outdoor burning bans were in effect in 104 of the state's 254 counties, and 86 counties banned aerial fireworks for the 11-day fireworks season that ran through New Year's Day. According to the Texas Cooperative Extension, the monetary damages for the 2005 drought have been estimated at $60 million for north central Texas.  The federal government estimated that the national net farm income for 2005 was down nearly $11 billion from 2004, with losses in Texas accounting for a significant portion of the decline.  Hay and pasture losses were estimated at 70% by the Farm Service Agency.  Due to the hay shortage, prices drastically increased, and feeding costs reportedly went up at least 50%.  Ranchers were forced to feed their livestock supplemental hay and protein for an extra three to five months.  Farmers also sold lighter calves for lower prices because they did not have enough grazing for the winter.  The remaining lighter calves will also bring a lower price next year.  In addition, ranchers struggled with dwindling water supplies as stock tanks throughout Texas ran low.  Many lakes in north Texas were 10 to 15 feet below normal pool elevation. The drought also caused numerous other problems, including cracked foundations and an increase in  pest problems, as animals looked indoors for food. 
598697	2005-01-10	FLOOD	UT	1	6	3e+08	0	M62VE A stalled storm system just off the southern California coast was able to tap abundant tropical moisture from the central Equatorial Pacific Ocean and dump copious amounts of rain and wet snow on many portions of Utah. The relatively warm air ahead of the storm raised snow levels and rain fell on an already deep snowpack and resulted in the second costliest natural disaster in state history. An estimated $300 million in damage was reported from flooding along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers in Washington County. One man was killed in the flooding near Quail Creek Reservior and three people perished in avalanches. The Virgin River water level reached a 25-year high and the Santa Clara River rose above any previously recorded level. 30 homes were destroyed as the Santa Clara changed course and cut through a portion of the community. Approximately 20 more homes were significantly damaged during this record flood event. This storm system also brought heavy and wet snowfall to elevations above 8000 feet. Many avalanches occurred throughout the state following the storm. A large avalanche killed a snowboarder in Ephraim Canyon. East of Mount Pleasant, a slide took the life of a snowmobiler.  Some of the higher snowfall and water equivalent totals include: Cedar Breaks 70" and 10.70" water, Kolob-Zion Park 60" and 8.70, Alta 58 and 9.13, Solitude 55 and 9.71, Brian Head 51, Laketown 47 and 3.67, Snowbird 32 and 5.46, Randolph 32 and 2.18, The Canyons 31 and 3.55, Long Valley
604559	2006-07-25	TSTM WIND	AZ	0	1	1.5e+08	0	Several cities throughout the central portion of Maricopa County had major wind damage as a series of thunderstorms and microbursts moved across the area.  According to the Salt River Project, an estimated 65 power poles were blown down, in parts of Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa. At one point, about 20,000 customers were without power. Arizona Public Service reported about 8,000 customers were without power. At Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, the official peak wind gust was 59 mph. However, winds at Williams Gateway Airport gusted to 86 mph and flipped a small twin-engine plane atop another aircraft. In Mesa, 35 schools reported damages due to the storm.  In addition to numerous trees and homes damaged by winds, locally heavy rainfall caused some flooding of streets thoughout the Valley. One of the heaviest amounts was 2.70 inches at Crossroads Park. 
605942	2006-01-01	FLOOD	CA	0	0	1.08e+08	0	Flooding from heavy rains in late December continued into the early morning of January 1st. Hardest hit areas in the County were Fairfax, San Anselmo, Novato, Inverness, Ross and Mill Valley. Across the County, 1600 homes, 240 businesses and 225 Government agencies were affected by the flood. San Anselmo was under 2 feet of water with an estimated 150 of its 230 businesses damaged at a price tag of around $40 million.
605951	2006-01-01	FLOOD	CA	0	0	1.04e+08	3e+06	The major flooding that began late in December continued into early January. Widespread low-land flooding across the county persisted with the hardest hit areas around the Russian River in Healdsburg and Guerneville. The Petaluma River also over-flowed its banks as did the Sonoma Creek. Total number of structures tagged by county officials with damage was 66 with property damage over $100 million.
606292	2006-07-16	EXCESSIVE HEAT	CA	46	18	170000	492400000	Arguably one of the hottest spells widespread across California, including Interior Central California, in the last 75 years occurred during a warm period that spanned from the 16th through the 27th of the month. Fresno City had 12 days in a row where maximum temperatures were at or above 105 degrees F. Numerous daily maximum and high minimum temperature records were both reset including the all-time high minimum temperature record for Fresno at 90F on the 23rd from that of 86F set in August of 1908. During the 5-day period from the 22nd through the 26th, Fresno had temperatures of 110F+ each day. The Southwest San Joaquin Valley maximum temperatures had 110F+ readings for a 6-day period from the 21st through the 26th.  Minimum temperatures during that warmest portion of the heat spell lowered only into the 80s for much of the Central and South San Joaquin Valley. Even the high foothill areas and Kern County Mountains were impacted as Yosemite Valley in the Southern Sierra Nevada at the 4000-foot elevation had maximum temperatures of 100F+ from the 22nd through the 27th with a 105F high on the 26th. In the high desert areas of Kern County Inyokern had 110F+ from the 22nd through the 27th with overnight lows in the upper 70s to around 80F. Several daily high temperature records were also established in the Kern Desert during the period. Peak energy use in the state hit an all time record, 6165 Megawatts, even though several thousand customers in Central California went without power and air conditioning for hours. Typical of the situation $100K of refrigerated products were lost at a single store in Northwest Fresno during a power outage on the 24th. Among the documented instances of power loss during the heat event, Fresno had 11,000 power customers without electricity on the 22nd and 14,000 on the 23rd. All 10,000 power customers in Lemoore in Kings County lost electricity for up to 4 hours during the afternoon of the 23rd, one of the hottest days, as power transformers failed in the heat. In Tulare County, portions of Exeter lost power during the evening of the 24th.       With accompanying high humidities, consistent light or calm winds, and long durations of high temperatures, the heat resulted in many deaths among residents of Interior Central California as well as a tremendous toll on area agriculture and specifically the dairy and cattle industry. Up to 57 people died as a result of the excessive heat in the Interior Central California 7-county area. Many but not all of these deaths were among the elderly and in urban areas. Milk and egg production losses were estimated at 10 to 15% during the heat spell along with an increase in livestock deaths (16,500 cows) and poultry deaths (700,000 chickens and 160,000 turkeys). Diminished yield in produce from field crops and orchards undoubtedly occurred and losses could only be estimated due to difficulties in assessing. One local county, Kings, estimated losses at 20% for almond production with $10 million in other crop losses. In addition to the loss of livestock and poultry due to the heat, area counties declared local emergencies due to rendering problems caused by the high number of livestock and poultry carcasses.

628864	2006-06-27	FLASH FLOOD	NY	0	0	2e+08	0	Tropical moisture streaming into upstate New York ahead of a frontal system which moved westward into the eastern Great Lakes by Tuesday morning the 27th started the flash flood problems in western Broome County early Tuesday. The rain abated for a time during the day Tuesday before another batch of heavy rain fell Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning as the front moved back east and combined with a low pressure system moving up the eastern seaboard.  This scenario spelled disaster for Broome County. Total rainfall for the three day period ending Wednesday was up to 9 inches, especially in the Conklin and Windsor areas, which were particularly hard hit. This additional heavy rain sent nearly all streams and creeks over their banks in what was the worst flash flooding this county has ever seen. The county's infrastructure was challenged as major flash flooding began around 5 pm EDT Tuesday and lasted into Wednesday afternoon. A total of at least 40 roads, 5 bridges, dozens of businesses and over 1800 homes were flooded. At least 800 homes in Broome County were destroyed   Damages are estimated at 200 million dollars. All major highways in the Binghamton area were closed due to the flooding including Interstate 81, Route 17, Route 26 and Interstate 88.  At least 6000 people were ordered to evacuate from both river and flash flooding. The Nanticoke Creek and Tracey Creek were among many creeks and streams causing major flooding. A state of emergency was declared Tuesday evening for Broome County. The National Guard was called out to assist in numerous water rescues, evacuations and to prevent looting. Hardest hit areas were Conklin, Kirkwood, Chenango Forks, Endicott, Vestal, Johnson City and Endwell. In Conklin, 50 percent of the business district was flooded. The National Guard had to airlift 300 people to safety who were stranded by flood waters as the evacuation shelter at the local high school became surrounded by flood waters. In Windsor, there were at least 100 people in shelters. Countywide over 3000 people were in shelters.  In addition to the flash flooding, the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers, which flow into the Binghamton area were at record high levels Wednesday. The rivers challenged the levee system that protects the city of Binghamton as the water overtopped and undermined the levee in spots. Many homes, roads and businesses along the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers were severely impacted by flood waters from Windsor to Conklin, Kirkwood, Binghamton, Vestal, Endwell, Johnson City, and Endicott. The flood was the worst in Broome County history as the Susquehanna River broke previous record stages by 3 to 4 feet with river gauging going back almost 100 years. Fortunately no one was injured or killed in Broome County from the massive floods.
628874	2006-06-27	FLASH FLOOD	NY	2	0	2.5e+08	0	Tropical moisture continued to stream northward into upstate New York ahead of a frontal system which slowly moved westward into the eastern Great Lakes by Tuesday morning the 27th. This tropical moisture developed a batch of heavy showers and thunderstorms across much of upstate New York late Monday evening the 26th through Tuesday morning the 27th. From 3 to 5 inches of rain fell across Delaware County by Tuesday morning.  The rain fell on saturated ground from previous rains that occurred Sunday and Monday leading to major flash flooding in Hancock, Colchester and surrounding areas by Tuesday morning.  Hancock experienced the worst flooding this town had ever seen with most of the downtown underwater. In addition, Walton, Downsville, Delhi and Sidney also became inundated with record flooding as intense rainfall focused on these areas later Tuesday. Numerous streams and creeks were flooding homes, businesses, roads, bridges and government facilities. Despite the major flash flooding that was occurring Tuesday morning, the situation was about to turn even more grim. The front, which was across the eastern Great Lakes Tuesday morning, moved back east and combined with a low pressure system that moved up the eastern seaboard by Tuesday night. This set the stage for additional heavy rains from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning deluging Delaware County with more rains that brought three day totals to 8 to 15 inches. This caused even more catastrophic flooding to most of the county by Wednesday morning the 28th.  At least 200 structures were damaged in Hancock alone, the entire business district of Walton was under 6 to 7 feet of water.  Several small streams and the Susquehanna River combined to cause major flooding in the village of Sidney, NY.  Many homes were flooded in Sidney with up to 6 feet of water. Amphenol Corporation in Sidney was flooded by up to 5 feet of water causing 40 million dollars worth of damage. The flooding also caused Interstate 88 to collapse early Wednesday morning near Unadilla killing two truck drivers. The flooding caused 189 million dollars worth of damage to roads alone. Damages are estimated at 250 million dollars from the floods. At least 1000 homes were damaged by flood waters with 30 homes completely destroyed. Hundreds of businesses were damaged including major corporations like Amphenol and Kraft foods. There were at least 10 businesses destroyed.  Over 500 people were evacuated with hundreds of people rescued from the flood waters. At least 20 bridges were flooded. During the height of the flood, all roads were closed in Delaware County as a state of emergency was declared Tuesday. This flood will go down as the worst flood on record ever experienced by Delaware County.  M?VE, M?VE
632820	2006-07-28	FLASH FLOOD	OH	1	0	3.2e+08	0	After a brief lull, heavy thunderstorm rains resumed just after midnight and devastating flash flood quickly developed.  As much as three inches of rain fell between 12:30 and 2:30 a.m.  By daybreak on the 28th, as much of 10 inches of rain had fallen on portions of Lake County since the first thunderstorms developed  during the afternoon hours of the 27th.  Rainfall totals included: 9.70 inches in Mentor; 7.95 inches in Concord; 6.89 inches in Kirtland; 6.30 inches just south of Painesville and 5.50 inches in Madison.  Nearly every community in Lake County was hard hit by flooding.  A 51 year old man disappeared around 2 a.m. while trying to move vehicles from flood waters at an Eastlake marina.  He was later found deceased along a beach in Mentor.  Thousands of homes were damaged and hundreds of people had to be evacuated.  Widespread evacuations began in Painesville and Madison between 3 and 4 a.m.  In Painesville, the Grand River rose from a stage of 2 feet on the morning of the 27th to 17.36 feet around 5 a.m. on the 28th establishing a new record stage.  The old record stage was 13.1 feet set in 1979.  Damage along the river was catastrophic and homes along Main Street, Millstone Drive, Gristmill Drive, Steele Avenue and Grand River Avenue were devastated.  A total of 81 homes were destroyed on these streets with dozens more heavily damaged.  Around 600 people had to evacuated from homes along the Grand River and approximately 25 people had to be rescued by boat from rooftops after flood waters climbed into the second floors of their homes.  Several other people had to be rescued by helicopter because the flood waters were flowing too fast to allow boat rescues.  In Madison Township, around 1200 people were evacuated from a mobile home park as flood waters began to encroach their neighborhhod.  Dozens of homes and business in the area sustained damaged, much of it caused by flooding from the Grand River.  State Route 84 was washed out by a creek near the Perry and Madison Township border.  Up to 70 boats and large sections of piers were torn loose along the Grand River and washed into Lake Erie.  Many of these boats were later deposited on beaches between Fairport Harbor and Madison.  A floating restaurant near the mouth of the Grand River broke free during the flooding and sustained considerable damage.  Homes along the mouth of the river in Fairport Harbor were littered with debris from damaged homes and businesses upstream.  The Chagrin River in Eastlake rose from a stage around 4 feet on the morning of July 27th to 14.77 feet at 4:30 a.m on the 28th.  Widespread damage was reported in both Eastlake and Willoughby from the resulting flooding.  Significant damage was also reported in portions of Mentor, Kirtland and Concord Township.   During this event emergency personnel conducted 41 separate resuce operations involving around 200 people.  Around 3,600 families in Lake County applied for flood assistance.  Approximately 100 homes were destroyed in the county with another 800 significantly damaged.  Almost all of these homes were in Painesville, Eastlake, Madison, Fairport Harbor or Concord Township.  Nearly 200 business were affected by flooding.  Five bridges were destroyed by flooding and at least eight roads were washed out.  Several bridges and many other roads were also damaged.  Two sewer plants sustained significant damage.  Damage to roads, bridges and other public infrastructure has been conservatively estimated to be around $15 million.  Damage in Lake County during this event was unprecedented.  The flooding has been tentatively classified as a 500 year event.  M51VE 
633913	2006-06-01	DROUGHT	OK	0	0	0	1.51e+08	The drought continued to affect the region during June. The drought remained at severe to extreme (D2-D3) levels throughout the area during the month with the worst conditions occurring in western Oklahoma. The month of June was the heart of the winter wheat harvest which showed losses to the wheat crop due to the drought. The area had been declared a federal disaster area so that farmers and ranchers could receive aid through loans. Only 53% of the acres of wheat planted were actually harvested with the rest of the acreage abandoned for loss. The average amount harvested in a year is usually about 75%. The quality of the wheat crop was also down with 23 bushels per acre produced compared to a 45 year average of 28.6 bushels per acre. The amount per acre is the lowest since 1995 and 1996. With the low wheat production of crop actually harvested and the amount of acres that were abandoned, the total monetary loss of the wheat crop due to the drought was roughly estimated at $150 million. The winter wheat crop was not the only aspect of the agriculture community that was affected by the drought. Pastures and hay production continued to remain low which affected ranchers and farmers that raise livestock. Farm ponds also continued to dry up. With the lack of food and adequate water, many farmers and ranchers continued to sell part or all of their herds. Those businesses that rely on the harvest of crops were also adversely impacted. The lack of rainfall continued to impact communities and outdoor recreation activities and their associated businesses. Additional towns instigated some level of water rationing in their communities. Low lake, river, and pond levels had also affected fishing, swimming, and boating activities. In some cases, the lakes had receded enough that boat docks and ramps were on dry land. The low lake levels also caused some parts of the lakes to become dangerous to boaters due to the lake bottom and the things laying on them being closer to the surface which had caused some accidents. The ongoing dry conditions also caused an increase in fire danger over the area, with much of the vegetation beginning to cure again after becoming green for a short time in the spring. Several wildfires occurred over the area during the month of June. Firefighters were able to contain the fires causing only a few hundred acres or less to burn per fire. 
639314	2006-01-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	1e+09	Drought conditions continued across north Texas as precipitation deficits increased.  This month, all of north Texas was classified in either extreme drought (D3) or exceptional drought (D4) as classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor.  Every county in north Texas was eligible for federal disaster relief due to the drought.  The weather continued to be unseasonable warm.  The average high temperature this January was 68.3 degrees, a full 14.2 degrees above normal.  This figure broke an 83-year-old record.   Wildfires continued to be a major problem in January, with a burn ban in place in every county.  A quarter of a million acres burned across Texas in the first half of the month, more than during all of 2005.  The ongoing drought combined with strong winds and low humidities to create a volatile fire situation in Texas.  On New Year's Day, several devastating wildfires erupted across north Texas.  Forty homes were destroyed in Montague County as a 17-mile long fire burned between Ringgold and Nocona.  Another grass fire in Johnson County burned 13 buildings and charred 1,800 acres.  In Eastland County, a fire encompassing more than 35,000 acres forced the evacuations of several communities and destroyed the city of Kokomo.  Thirty-six buildings were lost in the fire.  Several firefighters and civilians suffered burns, smoke inhalation, and heat exhaustion due to the fires. Hydrological and agricultural impacts worsened over the past month due to the lack of rainfall.  Most water reservoirs across north Texas were 60% to 85% of normal capacity.  Several lakes across the region were 10 to 15 feet below normal pool elevation.  The North Texas Municipal Water District implemented watering restrictions earlier than normal this year due to the lowering lake levels.  Watering restrictions were also in effect on a voluntary basis in some cities.  The Texas Cooperative Extension estimated agricultural losses for north Texas to be close to $1 billion in January.  Only half of the state's hay crop was fit for harvesting, and hay prices were three to four times their normal price.  Many other crops failed to grow at all.  Agricultural groups appealed for federal grants to aid the cattle industry.  One emergency measure considered by the federal government included providing cash to ranchers to offset high feed costs and losses due to the drought and wildfires. A drought summit was held in San Antonio to discuss the crisis.  The drought was also affecting wildlife in north Texas.  The Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife reported an overall decline in habitat conditions, and noted that the lack of green plants would affect the survival rate of certain animals.
639335	2006-02-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	3e+08	The hydrologic and agricultural drought which officially began in May continued across north Texas this month.  Many locations had precipitation deficits of 15 to 25 inches below normal for the past twelve months.  All of north Texas was again considered to be in either extreme or exceptional drought, as classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor.  Some areas along the Red River did see some rainfall this month, and the area of exceptional drought had shrunk considerably since last month.  With dry vegetation in place, the threat of wildfires remained quite high.  Strong cold fronts brought dry, windy conditions on several occasions to north Texas, which exacerbated the situation.  A drought disaster was declared for all Texas counties, and almost all north Texas counties were under burn bans.  Lakes across north Texas were on average 7 to 15 feet below normal elevation, and a few were even worse off.  The lower lake levels presented new hazards to boaters, as rock and other materials protruded from beneath the surface and edges of the lakes.  Several boat ramps were closed as a precaution.  City officials in Plano increased their water conservation efforts, asking the city's top 10 water users to identify ways to decrease their usage.  A conference was held in San Antonio to discuss the drought and find possible solutions.  Farmers and ranchers were having a particularly hard time with the drought's effects.  Hay was both very expensive and scarce in the state, and calves were being sold underweight.  This year's wheat crop was expected to be well below normal.  The cotton crop was also in danger of being below normal if ample precipitation didn't fall soon.  The Texas Farm Bureau set up a relief fund which donated hay, feed, wire, fence posts, addition workers, and money to help offset the costs incurred from the drought and related wildfires.  The United States Department of Agriculture decided to allow emergency grazing on Conservation Reserve Program land across Texas through June.  The Governor also temporarily suspended permit requirements and fees so that out-of-state hay could more easily reach those who needed it.   Many other effects were felt due to the drought.  Wildlife and native plants were suffering.  Many birds and other animals which nest on the ground were having a hard time finding food.  Cracked foundations were a common occurrence across north Texas.  One foundation repair company reported that the ground was so dry that they found problems with foundation piers 12 feet below the surface.
639354	2006-03-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	2e+08	The month of March had some much needed rainfall, falling mostly on only two days, the 18th and 19th.  This put Dallas/Fort Worth 1.34 inches above normal for the month.  However, twelve month rainfall deficits (from April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2006) remained high, with 13.38 inches lacking at Dallas/Fort Worth and 10.86 inches lacking at Waco.  Although this rainfall helped the crops and put some much needed water into lakes and reservoirs, the drought persisted.  March's rainfall helped drop north Texas down a category from Extreme to Severe Drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  Burn bans were still in place in several north Texas counties.   Wildfires continued to be a problem for north Texas.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated more than $8 million in Emergency Conservation Program funds this month for farmland in 16 Texas counties affected by wildfires.  In north Texas, Hood, Cooke, Parker, and Somervell Counties were designated to receive funds.  Farmers in these counties were able to go to their Farm Service Agency offices and apply for damages.  Aid requests were also sent to Congress by the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association.  The request sought funds to help feed livestock, repair fences destroyed by wildfires, and compensate producers who lost cattle and vegetation.  The USDA continued to offer conservation land for up to 60 days to farmers that needed grazing land for their cattle.
641233	2006-07-01	DROUGHT	TX	0	0	0	1.35e+08	Economical impacts from the long-term drought which began in late 2005 over the Southern Plains of the U.S. worsened over the extreme southern Texas Panhandle and the west Texas South Plains through the month of July. Extreme (D3) drought conditions were prevalent over the extreme southeastern panhandle by the end of the month, with severe (D2) drought conditions observed elsewhere east of the Interstate 27 corridor.  The agricultural portion of the region's economy was drastically impacted. Local farmers and agricultural officials reported increased losses in July, with 98% of the dryland cotton crops across the South Plains and southern Texas Panhandle failing to emerge. At least 670,000 acres of cotton were destroyed due to the lack of water during the month of July. Additional cotton crops also were destroyed by drought related haboobs and other convectively triggered dust storms. At least 7,000 acres of drought-stressed crops were destroyed by a haboob on July 12th. The drought also impacted many area ranchers. The lack of rain during the growing season resulted in poor hay crops. This caused the price of hay to exceed $130 per ton; up from only $80 per ton one year ago. Ranchers have had difficulty affording hay to feed the cattle, thus many head of cattle have been sold at very early ages resulting in lower selling prices.
641359	2006-08-01	FLASH FLOOD	TX	0	0	1.8e+08	0	Thunderstorms within a saturated atmosphere repeatedly developed and moved over mainly the northwest third of El Paso County, concentrating in an area over and near the Franklin Mountains. Rainfall reports varied from 4 to more than 6 inches within 15 hours in this area, with an isolated report of about 8 inches on the western slope of the mountain range. Antecedent conditions from 4 days of heavy rains, combined with terrain effects of the mountains led to excessive runoff and flooding not seen on such a large scale in the El Paso area in more than 100 years. The power of raging arroyos and street flooding on sloped terrain moved dozens of vehicles and trees through the west side of El Paso. There was considerable structural damage as well to residences and businesses. Numerous roads were closed due to high water and roadbed damage, with several rescues made from trapped vehicles. Interstate 10 was closed just east of downtown El Paso. Water reached a depth of 4 feet in many homes in west El Paso, especially in the upper valley section. By early evening the Rio Grande River crested at 9.3 feet, the highest stage in 50 years, and nearly breached the levee system. Residents in the downtown area near the river were evacuated. Other evacuations took place in Vinton, Canutillo and northeast El Paso. At least 800 people were put up in temporary shelters, some remaining for several days. Amazingly, there were no deaths or serious injuries. As a result of the incredible damage from extensive flash flooding, El Paso County was declared a federal disaster area. Because of this historic event and subsequent heavy rain events, large ponds of water would remain for weeks to come at the bottom of the valley (El Paso Upper Valley). Thus a few roads remained closed, mosquitoes flourished and spread West Nile Disease, and explosive weed growth brought misery to allergy sufferers. Some businesses were closed for weeks while repairs were made.
644508	2006-06-25	HAIL	WI	0	0	5e+08	1700000	A slow-moving thunderstorm moved from the Dekorra area southeast through the Poynette area to the North Leeds area, leaving in its wake a lot of crop damage due to hail.  A roughly 40 to 45-minute hail shower (stones up to the size of quarters) fell in a band from about 3 miles south-southeast of Dekorra along Kent Rd. to the McKenzie Environmental Education Center just northeast of Poynette.  Crop, vegetable, and fruit damage was noted, and in some cases, an entire year's crop was lost due to hail damage.  Many residential homes and vehicles were damaged.  Hail depth on some roads reached 8 inches and had to be plowed off the roads, especially along Kent Rd. and near the McKenzie Center.  The crop damage estimate is based on a newspaper report which quoted a USDA report.  The property damage is purely an estimate based on a variety of reports. Very slow moving clusters of thunderstorms developed across south-central Wisconsin during the early afternoon hours of June 25th.  Very heavy rains within these storms produced 3 to 5 inches of rain in some areas and resulted in flash flooding near Sun Prairie (Dane Co., Wyocena to Arlington (Columbia Co.), and Middleton (Dane Co.).  Road washouts, gravel shoulder washouts, and basement flooding were the main result from this flooding.  A large area of southern Columbia County had considerable flood and hail damage - refer to details in the specific line entries for flash flooding and hail events for this date.  The slow movement of the the thunderstorms amplified the damage.
647282	2007-03-01	TORNADO	AL	9	50	2.5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: A tornado touched down just southwest of the Enterprise Municipal Airport.  It caused minor damage to some houses.  Four chicken houses were destroyed.  The tornado then traveled northeast and quickly intensified as it moved into the Enterprise city limits.  It severely damaged the high school just north of the downtown.  Eight students were killed as walls collapsed on them while they took shelter in the interior hallways.  Fifty more were injured.  The football stadium was destroyed.  Many vehicles surrounding the schools were overturned or tossed about.  Several state roads were impassible due to debris and fallen utility poles and lines. The ninth fatality occurred where an elderly woman was standing behind a living room window of her home as the glass shattered.  A nearby elementary school was heavily damaged with no deaths or injuries reported there.  Damage near the high school and in northeast Enterprise reached low end EF-4.  Damage assessments indicated 239 homes destroyed, 374 homes with major damage, 529 homes with minor damage, and 251 homes affected.  Coffee County was declared a federal disaster area, with preliminary FEMA individual assistance figures totalling over $1 million. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of a warm front over the Florida Panhandle and moved northeast across southeast Alabama and into extreme southwest Georgia during the afternoon hours of March 1.  The strongest tornado, classified an EF-4, killed nine and injured 50 in Enterprise, Alabama.
649418	2007-06-24	WILDFIRE	CA	0	3	5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: The human-caused Angora wildfire started on June 24th and continued to burn through the end of June.  Strong winds gusting to 40 mph caused the wildfire to spread across 3,100 acres south of Lake Tahoe.  A total of 254 houses and over 60 commercial structures were destroyed. EPISODE NARRATIVE: High winds helped to spread the Angora wildfire across 3,100 acres south of Lake Tahoe.
649604	2007-10-22	WILDFIRE	CA	0	5	151100000	1.5e+07	EPISODE NARRATIVE: The Rice Fire started on October 22nd and burned 9,472 acres near Fallbrook. The fire destroyed 206 homes, 40 outbuildings, and 2 commercial properties. Crop damage was estimated at $14.6M. The cause of the fire was determined to be downed power line. Five injuries were reported. The Rice Fire cost $6.5M to fight and was one of thirteen large, wind-driven wildfires to impact the San Diego CWA in late October.
652307	2007-03-01	TORNADO	GA	2	8	1.1e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in southeast Webster county continued to track northeast from the southwest to the northeast corner of Sumter county and then continued into extreme southern Macon county before finally lifting.  The tornado tracked a total distance on the ground of approximately 40 miles.  The tornado entered Sumter county about 4.75 miles southwest of Plains in southwest Sumter county and exited the northeast part of the county about 9 miles north of Methvins in northeast Sumter county.  This was by far the most violent and devastating tornado of the March 1st outbreak.  The tornado tracked roughly 32 miles across Sumter county with a maximum path width of 1.0 mile wide, which occurred in the Americus area.  Damage within the city of Americus was extensive, although structures, trees, and power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The most significant damage in Americus was to the Sumter Regional Hospital, of which a significant portion was destroyed.  Hundreds of homes and businesses in the Americus area were either totally destroyed or sustained significant damage.  Hunderds of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed by debris and/or tossed about like matchsticks.  The majority of the damage was within the vicinity of the Sumter Regional Hospital.  Two deaths were reported at a home in Americus when a wall collapsed on a 43 year-old male and a 53-year old female.  At least eight injuries were documented, but there may have been more. Within the city of Americus, proper, there were 1235 total structures damaged or destroyed, including 217 businesses, 993 residences, 3 cemeteries, 10 churches, 1 fire station, 1 hospital, 8 recreational facilities/parks, and 2 schools.  There were 75 structures (42 businesses, 31 residences, 1 hospital, 1 church) were destroyed.  There were 148 structures (27 businesses, 116 residences, 3 recreational facilities/parks, 2 churches) with major damage.  There were 331 structures (60 businesses, 260 residences, 3 recreational facilities/parks, 5 churches, 1 school, 2 cemeteries) with major damage and 681 structures (88 businesses, 586 residences, 2 recreational facilities/parks, 2 churches, 1 school, 1 cemetery, 1 fire station) with minor damage. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A major, negatively tilted and closed upper trough rotated through the mid-south and southeast U.S. on March 1st.  A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million. Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.  The heaviest rainfall fell in the Hancock, Putnam, and Baldwin county areas, where some spots received in excess of six inches of rain.  Some flooding was reported in these areas.
652389	2007-04-07	FROST/FREEZE	GA	0	0	0	1.55e+08	EVENT NARRATIVE: A deep upper low over the northeast U.S. brought record cold to much of the eastern U.S. during the Easter weekend.  Temperatures averaged a good 20 degrees below normal during the period.  Widespread freezing temperatures were observed each morning from the 7th through the 9th, but the 7th and 8th brought the most widespread and coldest temperatures to the region.  Lows in the 20s were common across much of north and central Georgia, with lower 20s in parts of the northeast Georgia mountains.  Average freeze dates for most of the state are in late March.  Farmers in all of the north and central Georgia counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area were declared eligible for federal loans as a result of the unusually late hard freeze.  The unseasonable cold and freezing temperatures resulted in the loss of nearly 100 percent of the wine grape crop, 86 percent of the blueberry crop, 78 percent of the peach crop, 41 percent loss of grasses, 40 percent of grain loss (corn and wheat), and 29 percent loss of pecan crops.  Of these crops, wine grapes are nearly all grown in north Georgia and a substantial portion of the peach crop is grown in central Georgia, both in Peachtree City, Georgia's forecast area.  Total losses for the entire state as a result of the freeze were estimated at $258 million, of which 50 to 60 percent of this was estimated to be within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A deep upper low and over the northeast U.S. and associated large Canadian surface high pressure area brought record cold to much of the eastern U.S. during the Easter weekend.  Temperatures averaged a good 20 degrees below normal during the period.  Freezing temperatures were observed each morning from the 7th through the 9th, but the 7th and 8th brought the most widespread and coldest temperatures to the region.  Lows in the 20s were common across much of north and central Georgia, with lower 20s in parts of the northeast Georgia mountains.  Average freeze dates for most of north and central Georgia are in late March.  Farmers in all of the 96 north and central Georgia counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area were declared eligible for federal loans as a result of the unusually late hard freeze.  The unseasonably cold and freezing temperatures resulted in the loss of nearly 100 percent of the wine grape crop, 86 percent of the blueberry crop, 78 percent of the peach crop, 41 percent loss of grasses, 40 percent of grain loss (corn and wheat), and 29 percent loss of pecan crops.  Of these crops, wine grapes are nearly all grown in north Georgia and a substantial portion of the peach crop is grown in central Georgia, both within Peachtree City, Georgia's forecast area.  Total losses for the entire state as a result of the freeze were estimated at $258 million, of which 50 to 60 percent of this was estimated to be within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area.
653263	2007-09-01	DROUGHT	GA	0	0	0	3.44e+08	EVENT NARRATIVE: Drought conditions continued to worsen through the summer months across north and central Georgia.  Many areas of the state were nearing historical drought conditions by the end of the summer.  By the end of September, rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches across north and west Georgia were common, with many of these areas only having received 30 to 40 percent of normal rainfall.  Many lakes were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta. By the end of the summer, crop losses for the state as a whole were estimated at $787.2 million.  Approximately 44% or $344 million of this occurred within the Peachtree City, Georgia Weather Forecast Office (WFO) County Warning Area (CWA).  Crop losses were greatest for hay and pasture, cotton, peanuts, and corn.  The balance was a result of losses to the pecan, tobacco, fruit, and soybean crops.  Total economic output impact of the drought for the state was estimated to be $1.3 billion.  It is also interesting to note that there were over 14,000 agricultural jobs impacted by the drought conditions. Here is the breakdown of the drought impact on the above listed crops by county within the Peachtree City Weather Forecast Office (WFO) county warning area (CWA). Total average losses with the Peachtree City WFO CWA from the drought were estimated at $15M (million) per county for seven counties (Carroll, Crisp, Jackson, Oglethorpe, Sumter, Taylor, Wilcox, $7.5M per county for 16 counties, $2.5M per county for 54 counties, and $500K (thousand) for the remaining 19 counties. These losses can further be broken down into loss categories of hay and pasture, cotton, peanut, and corn. For hay and pasture losses, eight counties, Banks, Bartow, Carroll, Gordon, Jackson, Monroe, Oglethorpe, and Wilkes had the greatest losses in this category, each experiencing an average loss of $15.5M per county.  Twelve counties experienced an average loss of $4.5M per county, 37 counties had $1.5M per county, and 39 counties had $500K per county.   For cotton losses, Sumter county experienced the greatest loss with an average of $8.5M.  Two counties experienced an average loss of $4.5M, six counties had $1.5M, and the remaining 87 counties had $500K per county. For peanut losses, three counties experienced an average loss of $1.5M per county with the remaining 93 having an average loss of $500K per county. Finally, for corn losses, Jefferson county experienced the greatest loss with an average of $3M.  Three counties had a loss of $1.5M per county, four had $750K per county, while the remaining 88 counties experienced average losses of $300K per county. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Drought conditions continued to worsen through the summer months across north and central Georgia.  Many areas of the state were nearing historical drought conditions by the end of the summer.  By the end of September, rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches across north and west Georgia were common, with many of these areas only having received 30 to 40 percent of normal rainfall.  Many lakes were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta. By the end of the summer, crop losses for the state as a whole were estimated at $787.2 million.  Approximately 44% or $344 million of this occurred within the Peachtree City, Georgia Weather Forecast Office (WFO) County Warning Area (CWA).  Crop losses were greatest for hay and pasture, cotton, peanuts, and corn.  The balance was a result of losses to the pecan, tobacco, fruit, and soybean crops.  Total economic output impact of the drought for the state was estimated to be $1.3 billion.

658349	2007-05-04	TORNADO	KS	11	63	2.5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: This killer tornado started in Comanche county and crossed into Kiowa county at 2003 CST / 2103 CDT.  It curved north then northwest before making a complete loop northwest of Greensburg.  Thus, the path was 25.8 miles. This tornado destroyed nearly 95 percent of the town of Greensburg and despite adequate warning, unfortunately took the life of 11 people, some that were in basements.  First responders arriving on the scene requested three refrigerated refer trucks thinking there would be hundreds of fatalities. It also destroyed a dozen homes and a church south of Greensburg but did not cause injury.  In all, 961 homes and businesses were destroyed, 216 received major damage and 307 received minor damage.  As the tornado was dissipating it turned northwest, west, south and then back east making a loop.  This was documented on both high resolution doppler radar and through the ground survey.  Also as the tornado was dissipating a new circulation quickly grew northeast of town. Several oil storage tanks were destroyed causing an environmental concern.  In the town of Greensburg, hazardous material was strewn everywhere.  As of July 26th, the debris was still not fully cleaned up.  Two landfills were filled with debris from the town and this was even as most was burned.  Hundreds of thousands of dump truck loads were taken out.  It was estimated that approximately 400,000 cubic yards of debris was removed.  The major highway running through town was closed for 1 full month. At one time there were over 150 law enforcement officers (from all over the country) present.  Military was called in for debris removal and rebuilding.  Damage of insured losses exceeded $150 million, but including un-insured losses, was roughly 250 million dollars. **** NOTE **** The 11th victim passed away on September 19th, 2007 after a long battle with a head injury sustained during the tornado. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A destructive tornado, the first 5 rating on the new Enhanced-Fujita Scale and the first 5 classification since May 3, 1999 when an F5 tornado ripped through Moore, Oklahoma occurred on this day.  There were 12 tornadoes during about a 4 hour period, one a little over 2 miles wide! Two of the tornadoes existed for over 1 hour as they churned up the ground, leveling homes and causing fatalities along their path.  Miraculously, on 13 people perished, 11 in Greensburg - a miracle because over 90 percent of the town of Greensburg was literately wiped off the face of the earth.  Another round of tornadoes occurred the following day across generally the same area.  Nearly 250 pivot irrigation sprinklers were damaged or destroyed during the 2 day outbreak.  Due to the number of sprinklers involved and the lack of replacements, some farmers would be out of service for over 1 year.
667126	2007-07-01	FLOOD	MO	0	0	5000	5e+08	EVENT NARRATIVE: The Big Creek at Blairstown had its highest crest ever at 27.29 feet, or 7.29 feet above flood stage. Damage was to agricultural interests. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Heavy rains at the end of June, caused several rivers and creeks to experience moderate to major flooding, through  July 7th. Most damage was to crops in the adjacent low lands.
667182	2007-08-04	EXCESSIVE HEAT	MO	2	519	0	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: The first and only Heat Wave of the summer started in August 4th and lasted through August 16th. Eight deaths were reported in the St. Louis Metro area. The city of St. Louis reported 422 heat related injuries. St. Louis County reported 519 heat related injuries. At least 450 people were injured at an outdoor concert held on August 6th, and another 50 were injured at another outdoor concert on the 14th. Many schools across the region went to an early dismissal schedule to combat the heat. St. Louis hit 100 degrees on the 7th and 8th, 102 on the 12th, 103 on the 14th, and 105 on the 15th. The highs on the 14th and 15th set new records. Columbia hit 100 or higher on six days and set a new record of 103 degrees on the 16th. August 2007 ended up being the 3rd warmest on record for St. Louis and the 4th warmest on record for Columbia. The Department of Health and Senior Services reported at least 1300 heat related injuries across the state.
674929	2007-06-08	HAIL	OH	0	0	1.05e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: A severe thunderstorm moved across Summit County and caused unprecedented damage.  Hail as large as softballs fell across much of the county.  Extensive damage was done to homes and vehicles in Akron and surrounding areas.  As many as 29,000 insurance claims were filed for damage in the county.  The south side of Akron was the hardest hit. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A strong cold front moved through the area during the afternoon and early evening hours of the 8th. Numerous severe thunderstorms developed ahead and along this cold front. Severe weather occurred throughout most counties in the area stretching from Lucas County to Mahoning County.
676903	2007-12-09	ICE STORM	OK	0	0	1.5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: In addition to the above mentioned damage, all but the gym burned at Jones High School. Seven deaths were reported across the county due to the ice storm. The total estimated monetary damage listed is for the entire event that occurred in the National Weather Service County Warning Area. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A devastating ice storm affected a large swath of Oklahoma beginning on the 9th and continuing through the 11th over parts of the area. The storm left behind a trail of severe damage to trees and power lines, which in turn led to the worst power outage in Oklahoma history (in terms of the number of people impacted). This was because the worst of the ice storm affected the urban corridor from near Lawton, to Oklahoma City, to Tulsa, and northeast into Missouri. The storm began with a strong cold front that moved through the northern half of Oklahoma on the 8th, and then moved south through the rest of the state during the day on the 9th. South of the front, an almost tropical airmass was in place with temperatures in the 60s and 70s. Showers and thunderstorms were ongoing over central and southwest Oklahoma early on the 9th, but were developing and moving above a layer of freezing air at the surface. However, as the cold front moved south, the cold air undercut the thunderstorms, which became the start of many waves of freezing showers and thunderstorms. The very moist airmass south of the front continued to move over top of the shallow cold airmass through 11th. This classic setup created one of the most costly ice storms in Oklahoma history. By the time the storm had ended, over one inch of ice had accumulated over a good portion of Oklahoma. The governor declared a State of Emergency for all 77 Oklahoma counties. At least 27 deaths were reported statewide, mainly due to hundreds of automobile accidents, although some were due to prolonged cold air exposure or carbon monoxide poisoning. Most of the December 12th morning flights in and out of Will Rogers World Airport were canceled because of icy runways. Tree, power line and power pole damage was widespread statewide, which resulted in hundreds of thousands without power. Some of the trees that had to be cut back or cut down altogether were over 100 years old. At the peak of the event, more than 641,000 electric customers were without power (the actual number of people was likely much larger). Due to the magnitude of the outage, electrical crews from dozens of states worked 12-hour shifts daily to restore power. Even with this huge relief effort, more than 150,000 residents were still without power one week later. Even city water and sewage plants were without power, making them unable to pump water for a short time. Fallen power lines created another hazard as the broken lines sparked structure fires. Fire departments responded to over 100 structure fires in all. Other fires were caused by portable heating sources inside the home. Schools, churches, and local businesses had to close, some for several days due to the power outages. Christmas parades and area sporting events had to be rescheduled or canceled all together. Final exams at area colleges were also postponed. The local economy took a huge hit as the ice storm hit during a key weekend for holiday sales. The pecan crop loss alone was estimated at $25 million statewide. Shelters were opened across the state for people who did not have electricity, which many took advantage of. The storm cleanup was estimated to cost at least $200 million statewide. Cities were expected to remove over 750,000 cubic yards of debris.
684244	2007-06-26	FLASH FLOOD	TX	2	0	1.37e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: Two lines of thunderstorms, one moving south from the Dallas area and one moving southeast from the Abilene area, intersected and stalled near Marble Falls, producing a sustained heavy rainfall over Burnet County from just before midnight into the early and mid morning hours.  General rainfall over the southern half of Burnet County was between 10 and 15 inches with the highest rain totals in the Marble Falls area, where up to 19 inches fell. The hardest hit area was Marble Falls, where more than 315 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage occurred along Whitman Branch Creek.  This included businesses and even a day care facility.  Personnel from Texas Military Forces were mobilized and sent into Marble Falls to help with rescues and evacuations.  The military personnel, along with swift water rescue and other first responders, completed 32 high water rescues and evacuated hundreds of residents.  Shelters were set up at the Marble Falls Middle School.  At least eight bridges in Burnet County were destroyed with some amount of damage to nearly every road and structure in the southern half of the county.  Most roads remained closed all day, but a few were re-opened in the late afternoon.  Cars and vans were strewn all up and down US281 in the Marble Falls area.  Nearly all parks and lakes were closed.  Businesses in Marble Falls were also closed. Drinking water in Marble Falls was contaminated by the flood and over 1000 residents were without water for at least a week. Total estimates of the damages were placed at $130,000,000.  One swift water rescue team member was forced to save himself when his vehicle was washed off SH71 near Double Horn Creek.  He was able to get to dry land after a prolonged struggle.  A couple in Marble Falls awoke to find their home flooded and with the water rising rapidly.  They scrambled to the highest point in the one-story house as the water continued to rise.  Finally, they had to use a shotgun to blast holes in the ceiling so they could break through to climb up on the roof.  They waited with their two dogs on the roof in the dark for 2 hours, then were able to climb down and take shelter in a barn as the water receded slightly.  They waited for an additional 12 hours until they were finally rescued by boat.  Two young men were attempting to drive from a home in Marble Falls to Leander via FM 1431 sometime in the early morning hours of June 27 when their jeep was swept into high water east of Marble Falls. The vehicle was located a few days later in a creek about 10 miles east of Marble Falls.  The body of one of the young men was recovered several days later but the remains of the other young man have not been found. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A thunderstorm outflow boundary from storms in the Dallas area moved southward into South Central Texas as a second outflow boundary from thunderstorms in the Abilene area moved southeastward.  The two boundaries collided near Marble Falls shortly after midnight on June 26 and produced sustained periods of very heavy rainfall across several counties.
694619	2008-11-15	WILDFIRE	CA	0	0	1.5e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: The Freeway Complex Fire began in the Santa Ana River bottom near Corona on November 15, 2008. Dry, Santa Ana winds caused the fire to quickly spread into the Chino Hills and the nearby cities of Yorba Linda, Anaheim Hills, and Brea. The Freeway Complex Fire burned 30,305 acres and forced the evacuation of about 40,000 people. The fire damaged 127 homes, 2 commercial properties, and 32 outbuildings. The fire destroyed 187 homes, 2 commercial properties, and 11 outbuilding.
695070	2008-05-22	TORNADO	CO	1	78	1.47e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: A powerful tornado swept north-northwestward across Weld County and into Larimer County, carving a path of destruction, nearly 39 miles in length. The tornado, up to one-mile wide at times, initially touched down northeast of Platteville and finally lifted 6 miles west-northwest of Wellington.  A tornado assessment in the aftermath of the tornado revealed extensive areas of damage. On the enhanced Fujita Scale there were pockets of EF3 damage, mainly near the Missile Silo Park Campground, and to businesses and home in eastern Windsor.  There was one fatality, and 78 injuries. One man was killed when he tried to escape the trailer park in his motor home.  Preliminary estimates from FEMA indicated 850 homes were damaged, and nearly 300 homes were significantly damaged or destroyed. Privately insured damages totaled $147 million, and the Poudre Valley Rural Electric Associated reported $1 million of damage to electric transmission lines.

A tornado assessment in the aftermath of the tornado revealed extensive areas of damage.  On the enhanced Fujita Scale there were pockets of EF3 damage, mainly near the Missile Silo Park Campground, and to businesses and home in eastern Windsor.  Farmers also reported extensive damage to crops and irrigation equipment.   There was one fatality, and 78 injuries ranging from broken bones to minor cuts and lacerations.  One man was killed when he tried to escape a trailer park in his motor home.  Tractor trailers were flipped along U.S. Highway 85, and over 200 power poles were snapped or blown down. Approximately 60,000 people were left without electricity.  The tornado overturned 15 railroad cars and destroyed a lumber car on the Great Western Railway of Colorado.  The tornado also flattened Windsor's main feedlot and destroyed a dairy barn.  Most of the four-hundred cows were killed in the tornado or destroyed later. In addition to the damaging winds, the thunderstorm also produced hail up to the size of baseballs.   Another tornado rated an EF1, from a separate severe thunderstorm, briefly touched down near Dacono and destroyed 5 buildings. The tornado overturned a five-wheel trailer and injured the man who was sitting inside.   Preliminary estimates from FEMA indicated 850 homes were damaged, and nearly 300 homes were significantly damaged or destroyed.  The Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association reported $1 million of damage to electric transmission lines.  Privately insured damages totaled $147 million, making it the state's 4th costliest disaster.
702051	2008-06-05	FLOOD	IN	0	0	1.5e+08	1.5e+08	EVENT NARRATIVE: Flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Bartholomew County, including in Columbus, due to heavy rain. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Massive and historic flooding struck central Indiana.  In Indiana alone, flood waters affected over 25,000 people.  This flood affected about 9% of the state's farmland.  The Great Flood of June 2008 was one of Indiana's costliest natural disasters.  Heavy rainfall on May 30th allowed streams and rivers to rise.  Additional heavy rainfall on the 3rd and the 4th added to these high levels.  Severe weather brought heavy rainfall on the 6th as well.  The stage was set for historic flooding in portions of central and southern Indiana.  The storms on the 6th exacerbated the situation by laying down a boundary in southern Illinois and southern Indiana.  A moist southerly low level jet rode over this boundary for more than 12 hours continually generating showers and thunderstorms.  Rainfall of two to nearly eleven inches fell across portions of central and southern Indiana.  The impact of the rain was immediate with widespread flooding developing and major roads and interstates flooded.  This episode is in reference to flooding of the East Fork White River.
703757	2008-06-01	FLOOD	IA	0	0	1e+05	2.5e+08	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Iowa came off of a very wet May, only to be followed by a near record wet June.  Some of the flooding along Iowa's rivers continued from May into June.  Heavy rains fell on a nearly daily basis somewhere in Iowa through the first half of the month.  The first series of heavy rain events caused flooding over a large part of Iowa.  Some of the flooding began as flash flooding, then transitioned into general river flooding.  A considerable amount of agricultural land was put under water due to the extensive river flooding.  This began what would be a catastrophic loss in agricultural production.
703772	2008-06-01	FLOOD	IA	0	0	2.3e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: The record crest on the Iowa River at Iowa City occurred on June 15, 2008 at 31.53 feet. Flood stage is 22 feet. The record crest on the Iowa River at Lone Tree occurred on June 15, 2008 at 23.15 feet. Flood stage is 15 feet. Preliminary damage estimates just to the University of Iowa at Iowa City was at least $230 million. This compares to $6 million in damages during the Great Flood of 1993. Water flowed over the spillway at the Corps of Engineer's Coralville Reservoir for only the third time since the reservoir began operation on September 17, 1958. (The previous two times occurred in the summer of 1993). The result was unprecedented flooding downstream of the reservoir in the cities of Iowa City and Coralville. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Major to record flooding occurred during the month of June 2008 with most forecast points above flood stage for the majority of the month.  The flooding during this month was more prolific and severe than the flooding in April 2008, and the flooding in April had been the most prolific flood event since 1997. While some locations were still experiencing flooding as June began, many of the tributary rivers to the Mississippi in Iowa rose above flood stage during the first few days of the month.  At locations that were already above flood stage, the rivers stopped their fall and began climbing again. Persistent heavy rain from late May into early June resulted in record crests on the Cedar and Iowa Rivers in Iowa as well as other tributary rivers to the Mississippi River in eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin. This resulted in record flooding on parts of the Mississippi River, even exceeding flood levels reached during the Great Flood of 1993 in some locations.  Both the Mississippi River and the Rock River rose above flood stage at most locations around June 10th.  Most locations on the tributary rivers and the Mississippi River fell below flood stage during the last two-thirds of the month. The Cedar, Iowa and Mississippi Rivers were hardest hit by this flooding.  (The Mississippi River was most affected downstream of New Boston Lock and Dam 17.)  All forecast points on the Cedar and Iowa Rivers saw record crests during the month.  Three locations on the Mississippi River downstream of New Boston Lock and Dam 17 saw record crests.  In some locations, the new record crests were considerably higher than the previous record crests.  The most significant example was the Cedar River at Cedar Rapids, IA.  The crest during this event was 31.12 ft set on 6/13/2008.  The previous record crest was 20.00 feet set on 6/1/1851. The crest on the Cedar River became increasingly higher as it moved through the eastern IA from Waterloo, IA because of additional rainfall.  Additional heavy rainfall occurred between when the crest left the Waterloo area and when it arrived in the Cedar Rapids area.  In addition, heavy rainfall led to flash flooding when the Cedar River crest reached Cedar Rapids.  Unprecedented flooding occurred at many locations along the Cedar River, including the cities of Vinton and Cedar Rapids.  According to the Cedar Rapids media, very preliminary damage estimates from this flood are estimated to be at least $750 million in that area alone.  The damage estimate may go much higher. On the Iowa River, water flowed over the spillway at the Corps of Engineer???s Coralville Reservoir for only the third time since the reservoir began operation on September 17, 1958.  (The other two times occurred during the Great Flood of 1993.)  Unprecedented flooding occurred downstream of Coralville Reservoir including the cities of Iowa City and Coralville.  The University of Iowa sustained serious damage in Iowa City due to the flooding.  The latest damage estimate from the University of Iowa is $230 million which is much higher than the $6 million in damages that occurred during the Great Flood of 1993. Many roads in eastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois sustained severe damage from the flooding.  The flooding also forced the closure of many roads including I-80, I-380 and US 34.  On I-80, flood waters from the Cedar River flowed over the interstate resulting in its closure between interchanges #265 and #267.  This location is between Iowa City, IA and Davenport, IA.  The detour route was designated as US 61 to US 20 to I-35.  This detour added 115 miles to the normal route. In addition, flooding from Coralville Lake resulted in the closure of I-380 between interchanges #4 and #10.  This location is between Cedar Rapids, IA and Iowa City, IA.  The detour route for I-380 was designated as I-80 to I-35 to US 20 to I-380.  This detour added 272 miles to the normal route. As the record flooding pushed downstream on the Cedar and Iowa Rivers, it continued bringing unprecedented impacts to many locations along those rivers.  Several levee breaches occurred on the Iowa River (below Columbus Junction, IA) and the Mississippi River (below New Boston IL LD17).  A levee breach on the Mississippi River affected the Burlington, IA area.  A levee breach on the Illinois side of the river resulted in the flooding of Gulfport, IL and the closure of the US Hwy 34 bridge. As of August 6, 2008 the governor of Iowa estimated damage to the entire state of Iowa from the flooding could be as high as $10 billion.

711101	2008-09-01	HURRICANE	LA	0	0	1.5e+08	3e+07	EVENT NARRATIVE: Hurricane Gustav moved across St. Mary Parish, damaging thousands of homes and businesses. Hardest hit areas were the Morgan City and Patterson areas.In Morgan City, the water plant, steam plant, and electric plant were damaged. In Franklin an elementary school lost part of the roof. While the wind damage was severe, it was not as bad as Hurricane Andrew in 1992. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Hurricane Gustav caused wind damage, flash flooding, and several tornadoes across southwest Louisiana. Hustav made landfall in Terrebonne Parish in the morning of September 2nd as a category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 110 mph. Gustav moved northwest, almost up along Highway 90 across St. Mary, Iberia, St. Martin, and Lafayette Parishes. The highest measured wind gusts were 85 mph at a research site near Abbeville, LA in Vermilion Parish. However, wind speeds were estimated between 75 and 85 mph from St. Mary Parish to Evangeline Parish. Storm surge was a minimal impact because southwest Louisiana was on the west side of the onshore winds for most of the event. The highest recorded storm tide was 4.77 at Amerada Pass in St. Mary Parish. However, rainfall was a large impact. In central Louisiana, over 20 inches of rain fell in Rapides Parish, with a CO-OP observer recording 20.43 inches 7 miles east of Alexandria. This resulted in widespread flooding of the Alexandria-Pineville region, where over 200 water rescues were performed. Significant flooding also occurred in New Iberia, where over ten inches of rain fell, resulting in widespread flooding in and around New Iberia. Several tornadoes were seen across southwest Louisiana, with the worst one occurring in Evangeline Parish near Mamou, where two people were killed when their tied-down mobile home was thrown for over 200 yards. Other fatalities in the region were considered indirect. Two men died in Calcasieu Parish from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running in their home. A woman died in St. Martin Parish when her home caught fire from burning candles after she lost power. Total property damages were estimated near 750 million dollars in southwest Louisiana. Agricultural loses were estimated to be over 225 million dollars.
728132	2008-03-07	WINTER STORM	OH	0	0	7.5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: Snow developed during the morning hours of the 7th, and continued for the next day and a half. Intensity varied through the day on the 7th, but during the evening hours the snow became rather light for a period of time. However, the snow intensified through the overnight and into the morning hours of the 8th. By the end of the event, between 9.0 and 15.0 inches of snow fell across the area. Gusty winds between 20 and 30 mph during the morning and afternoon of the 8th caused considerable blowing and drifting of snow. Many accidents were reported from this storm. EPISODE NARRATIVE: On the morning of March 7th, low pressure was located along the Gulf Coast States. Snow spread into the region during the morning and afternoon hours, then tapered off a bit during the evening and overnight into the 8th. Snow intensified across the area as low pressure moved north into the Carolinas by the morning of the 8th. Snow persisted across much of the area, but did mix with sleet and freezing rain at times across far eastern Ohio. By the evening hours of the 8th, snow began tapering off from west to east. Any areas of mixed precipitation across far eastern Ohio changed back to snow before ending. The low pressure continued intensifying as it moved into New England by the morning hours of the 9th. Some light snow and flurries persisted overnight, mainly from around Cleveland and points east, but by midday on the 9th the snow tapered off across the entire area. Throughout this event, locations across northwest Ohio picked up between 5.0 and 10.0 inches. Those locations experienced a rather steep gradient for snowfall totals. In eastern Ohio, snowfall amounts were slightly lower as sleet and freezing rain mixed in at times causing reduced snowfall amounts. Locations across northeast and north-central Ohio saw the greatest snowfall amounts with 21.5 inches in Broadview Heights in Cuyahoga County, and 21.0 inches in Galion located in Crawford County.
729069	2008-09-14	HIGH WIND	OH	0	0	128700000	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: Strong winds of 40 to 50 miles per hour were sustained for several hours. The Columbus International Airport gusted to 75 mph, with 69 mph gusts recorded at Lockbourne and Urbancrest. Widespread damage occurred across the region, from trees being blown down on powerlines, to significant crop losses and structural damage. EPISODE NARRATIVE: The remnants of hurricane Ike raced northeast through the midwest and merged with a frontal boundary across the lower Ohio Valley Sunday morning. Abundant sunshine promoted deep mixing of the atmosphere, and warm, dry air aloft translated down to the surface. Gusty winds in excess of 70 mph persisted for a period of several hours, causing significant damage and widespread power outages.
730741	2008-06-05	THUNDERSTORM WIND	OK	0	0	7.5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: Substantial wind damage was reported in Altus. One hundred and seventy-nine homes sustained some kind of damage, with two destroyed, five with major damage, forty-three with minor damage, and one hundred twenty-nine affected. Seventeen businesses were damaged, with two destroyed, four with major damage, and eight with minor damage. One hundred and seventy power poles and numerous trees were blown down. Sixty percent of the town was without power at one point. Roof damage was reported to several buildings. Part of the roof at Altus Junior High caved in. Several buildings on East Broadway had roofs blown off or collapsed. Highway 62 was closed on the east side of town due to debris.. One injury was reported when a semi-truck was blown over injuring the driver. A train car also was overturned on the southeast side of town. No injuries were reported with it. Monetary damages were estimated. EPISODE NARRATIVE: An unusually strong storm system entered the northwest United States and moved southeast toward the Four Corners region. Surface low pressure developed over southeast Kansas and deepened rapidly. Surface winds over Oklahoma also steadily increased, with sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph and wind gusts over 50 mph reported at times. These non-thunderstorm winds caused some minor damage throughout the day. By mid afternoon, the storm system had moved toward the plains, with widespread thunderstorms developing from South Dakota into northern Texas. Over Oklahoma, thunderstorms developed along and east of a dry line that was located near the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. The thunderstorms took some time before becoming severe, but due to the degree of instability and wind shear farther to the east, supercell thunderstorms finally emerged. Damaging wind gusts and large hail occurred as the storms moved northeast at 45 to 60 mph. Numerous wind gusts of over 80 mph were reported, with many locations reporting wind damage as the thunderstorms passed. Heavy rainfall also occurred, with some locations receiving 3.50 to 4.50 of rain. Several roadways had to be closed due to water running over them. Monetary damages were estimated.
737149	2008-03-31	HAIL	TX	0	0	1.2e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: Fire department reported that car windows and sky lights and the roofs of many homes throughout the city were damaged from this devastating hail storm. Preliminary monetary estimate at the time of this publication was near 90 million dollars with local emergency management officials saying this amount would likely increase. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Severe thunderstorms developed along and ahead of an approaching cold front across the middle Red River valley of northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma as well as southwest Arkansas during the afternoon and evening hours of March 31st. These storms developed in an very unstable atmosphere and produced large hail...damaging wind gusts.  Isolated tornadoes were reported across McCurtain County, Oklahoma late in the evening.  The hail was large enough to break out automobile and home windows across the city of Texarkana, Texas close to midnight.
739513	2008-09-12	STORM SURGE/TIDE	TX	0	0	5e+08	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: A 14-15 storm surge at Sabine Pass resulted in the highest water level ever recorded at that location. Any home that was not elevated was destroyed. The storm surge did not top the seawall in Port Arthur, but wave action on top of the surge did. At least 100 homes were flooded in Port Arthur. The surge also backed up Hillebrandt and Taylor Bayou west of Port Arthur, causing widespread flooding in the Hillebrandt, Hamshire, and Fannett communities. The surge also backed up the Neches River in Beaumont, where some homes along the river flooded. In total, at least 4000 homes were flooded county-wide. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Hurricane Ike caused wind damage and significant storm surge flooding across southeast Texas. Ike made landfall near Galveston, TX early in the morning on September 13th as a strong category 2 hurricane. Sustained hurricane force winds were confined to Jefferson County, Hardin County, western Orange County, southernwestern Jasper County, and western Tyler County. The highest recorded winds were at Southeast Texas Regional Airport with sustained winds of 61 kts (70 mph) and gusts of 83 kts (96 mph). The lowest pressure reading also occurred at Southeast Texas Regional Airport, with a low of 982.4 mb. No tornadoes were reported in southeast Texas. Storm surge was a significant event. Sabine Pass had its highest water level recorded during Ike, with a maximum of 14.24 ft MLLW. This storm surge almost topped the seawall around Port Arthur, but large waves did crash over the seawall, causing some flooding of homes within 3 blocks of the seawall. In Orange County, Bridge City had nearly all of their homes flooded (over 3000), and this extended north to Rose City, and northeast to the city of Orange, where water topped the levee on the east side of town. Over 3000 homes were also flooded in Orange. Maximum storm total rainfall was between 5 and 8 inches across Jefferson, Hardin, Orange, and southern Jasper counties. Only one fatality occurred during Ike. A 40 year old man was trying to drive back to his home in Port Neches. His truck was swept off Highway 73 near Rainbow Bridge by the large storm surge and waves. Total damages, however, were high. Loses are estimated to be at least 1.3 billion dollars across southeast Texas.
739514	2008-09-12	HURRICANE	TX	0	0	1e+09	0	EVENT NARRATIVE: Ike produced damage due to high storm surge and high winds along Galveston Island, the Bolivar Peninsula, and along the Galveston Bay. Storm tides of 10 to 15 feet above mean sea level were observed in these areas. Several indirect fatalities due to preexisting medical conditions, lack of power and availability to dialysis, etc. Number of injuries unknown. EPISODE NARRATIVE: The eye of Hurricane Ike moved ashore in Galveston County near the city of Galveston. At landfall, Ike had a central pressure of 951.6 mb, as measured at Galveston Pleasure Pier, and a maximum estimated storm surge of 17 feet over portions of Chambers County and the Bolivar Peninsula. Maximum sustained winds at landfall were estimated at 95 knots (110 mph) with gusts to 110 knots (127 mph). A ship near the coast recorded a wind gust of 105 knots as the eye came through. At landfall, Ike was a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale based on wind speed, but due to its large size, had a storm surge more typical of a category 3 or 4. The height of the storm tide ranged from 4 to 6 feet in Matagorda county, 6 to 9 feet in Brazoria county, 10 to 13 feet along most of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay, to as high as 17 feet over portions of the Bolivar Peninsula and Chambers County. The majority of property damage at the coast was a result of storm tide.  Collectively, damage amounts are estimated to be near 14 billion dollars over the counties of Harris, Chambers, Galveston, Liberty, Polk, Matagorda, Brazoria, Fort Bend, San Jacinto, and Montgomery with an estimated 8 billion of that due to storm surge in coastal Galveston, Harris and Chambers Counties. Fresh water flooding also occurred near the city of Houston where up to 14 inches of rain fell over a two day period, first from Ike, then from a line of thunderstorms associated with a cold front moving through the following day. The number of fatalities directly related to Ike was 12 in the aforementioned counties with 11 of those occurring in Galveston County from drowning due to the storm surge. In addition, there were at least 25 fatalities indirectly related to Ike, either due to carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, accidents while clearing debris, or house fires from candles. There were no known tornadoes associated with Ike.

In the Wenatchee area, there was an estimated loss of 90 million dollars to the cherry crop, and 15 million to the pear crop.  The coldest morning was April 21st where the Wenatchee Airport reported a low of 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
743325	2008-06-08	FLASH FLOOD	WI	0	0	102220000	3.5e+07	EVENT NARRATIVE: Heavy rains resulted in flash flooding across much of Jefferson County.  Water depths on road surfaces reached 3 feet or more and there were gravel washouts.  The rain on June 12th ultimately lead to record-setting crests on the Rock and Crawfish Rivers, and many farm fields remained flooded into early July.  The cities of Watertown, Jefferson, and Ft. Atkinson were hard hit by high river levels.  The breakdown on residential home damage losses were: 100 with minor damage, 400 with major damage, and 10 destroyed (total of about $36 million).  Business losses totaled abouit $21.4 million.  Crops losses were estimated at $35 million.  Public sector damage was about $44.811 million.  There were several roads and bridges that sustained damage. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A slow-moving surface boundary, nearly parallel with the mid-level flow affected  southern Wisconsin during the period of June 7th through June 9th.  A strengthening low-level jet and strong moisture advection produced several rounds of thunderstorms during the period in the vicinity of this boundary.  The atmosphere was very moist with precipitable water values around 2 inches.  Low to mid-level wind flow supported training of flood-producing thunderstorms.  A weak cool front pushed through southern Wisconsin late on the 8th/early on the 9th, finally ending the heavy rainfall. The heavy rain axis for June 7-9th ran from Sauk County southeast to Milwaukee County, where generally 6 to 9 inches fell on a ground that was totally saturated due to record-setting winter snowfalls and a wet April, 2008.  Several locations topped 10 inches, and Watertown (Jefferson Co.) came in with 13.5 inches, 11.35 inches was measured in Oak Creek (Milwaukee Co.), and Elm Grove in Waukesha County picked up 10.8 inches.
751368	2009-03-25	HAIL	TX	0	0	1.6e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A cold front stalled across South Central Texas on the morning of March 25th. The subtropical jet and a mid/upper-level short wave trough pushed into the region. Convection initiated across San Angelo's county warning area in the morning and spread to the southwest. Thunderstorms reached the Edwards Plateau by early afternoon and continued moving toward the east into the evening.  Total estimated loss from this storm is around $160 million dollars...the most ever for an Austin hail storm.  The top three hail storms that have hit Austin have all occurred on a March 25th.  March 25, 1993 saw losses at $125 Million...and March 25, 2005 had $100 Million in losses.EVENT NARRATIVE: A thunderstorm moved through the Austin area and produced hail ranging from quarter to teacup size. We received 14 reports of severe size hail, nine of which were two inches or larger. The teacup size hail was reported by the media and fell near the Austin Arboretum.
756769	2009-04-11	HAIL	TX	0	1	161200000	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: On April 11, 2009, a surface high northeast of the region resulted in easterly upslope flow over most of the CWA.  Meanwhile, a mid to upper level low near Southern California approached the area from the west.  Although the deepest moisture was confined to the Gulf Coast (due to the previously mentioned surface high) there was enough moisture convergence along a stalled surface boundary and dryline.  Most unstable CAPE values along these features of 1000 j/kg and 0-6 km bulk shear magnitudes of 60 kt allowed for severe storms to develop as the dynamics neared the area during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued from 1520-2300 local.EVENT NARRATIVE: Numerous roofs throughout Midland, TX were damaged during this event.  A local newspaper clipping with a quote from a major roofing company estimated 40 to 50 percent of the homes in Midland needed to be re-roofed.  The average cost to replace a shingled roof is anywhere from $8-$10K.  This resulted in an estimated $160 million in roof damage.  In addition to homes being damaged, multiple vehicles also received damage from the hail.  According to local dent repair shops and car dealers across the area, an estimated 800 vehicles had to be repaired resulting in $1.2 million in damage.  A Midland woman was also struck in the stomach by a hail stone, after it broke through her dining room window.  Her injuries were only minor and did not require medical attention.
757436	2009-04-09	TORNADO	AR	3	30	1.3e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Low pressure aloft approached from the west and collided with moisture and instability. Thunderstorms developed in eastern Oklahoma during the afternoon, then became more numerous as they entered western Arkansas during the evening. The storms brought a few tornadoes and numerous hailstorms to Arkansas during the evening hours.EVENT NARRATIVE: A tornado began to the west-southwest of Mena, then tracked through the northwest side of Mena.  According to the Polk County Judge, 165 houses were destroyed, 701 houses had major damage, and more than 11,000 trees were blown down.  The Polk County Courthouse, county jail, Mena City Hall, and the police and fire departments were damaged in downtown Mena, as were several businesses.  Mena Middle School, also located downtown, was structurally damaged beyond repair.  A nursing home was also damaged.  Most of the city lost electricity.  The tornado then tracked to the northeast, badly damaging several industrial buildings.  There was considerable roof damage at Rich Mountain Community College, and lesser damage to the hospital.  As the tornado continued to the northeast, a tractor dealership was destroyed.  A number of rural residences and farms were damaged as the tornado moved out into rural Polk County.  North of Ink, damage was noted along Polk 74 and Polk 71; these same areas had been damaged by a tornado on October 6, 2008.  Three fatalities occurred on the northwest side of Mena.  One was a woman at a Masonic Lodge, and the others were a man and woman at separate residences.
761621	2009-05-08	THUNDERSTORM WIND	IL	0	1	1.75e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A mature, very intense derecho moved rapidly east along a stationary front across the Mid Mississippi Valley into the Lower Ohio Valley. With a very moist and unstable atmosphere, along with strongly veering winds aloft, embedded tornadic supercells were associated with the derecho. Widespread damaging winds were the primary impact. Nearly all the damage in southern Illinois was associated with the comma head at the northern end of the bow echo. Winds were measured slightly over 100 mph under the comma head as it passed through the Carbondale area. In addition to damaging winds, the slow-moving storm complex dumped very heavy rain that flooded roads.EVENT NARRATIVE: Widespread wind damage occurred countywide. Extensive tree and power line damage resulted in power outages up to several days long. Many power poles were snapped. Countywide, efforts to restore power were complicated by swampy fields, mud, and downed trees. Ninety-five percent of the county was without power at the peak of the outages. Numerous permanent structures were damaged, including major businesses in downtown Marion and Herrin. A total of 33 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. It is estimated that over 10,000 homes in the county received minor damage (less than 50,000 dollars per house). Gas leaks were common. Most communication by phone was impossible, including cell phones. Stores were closed, making groceries and gas very difficult to obtain locally in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Travel was nearly impossible due to debris and trees blocking roads. While about two dozen people were treated for storm-related injuries at local hospitals, all but one of them was due to post-storm cleanup. Many school facilities were damaged. The roof of Carterville High School was severely damaged. Several windows were blown out of the school. Minor damage occurred at athletic facilities, including the roof blown off a baseball dugout. Many outbuildings and small structures were destroyed across the county. In Carterville, a garage was lifted and dropped on a vehicle. Many vehicles countywide were damaged or destroyed by falling tree and building debris. A state disaster declaration was granted. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, and a state of emergency was declared. The Williamson County airport near Marion reported a peak gust of 86 mph. Based on the most severe structural damage east of the airport, peak winds were estimated by storm surveyors close to 100 mph. There was extensive damage at the airport, including hangar buildings. A television station on Route 13 was knocked off the air due to structural and roof damage. All along Route

There were a number of reports of hail, wind damage, and a few tornadoes across the region. One of the strongest storms moved across Sharkey county. This storm produced an EF1 tornado in the Delta National Forest. Another strong storm produced three injuries in Rankin County, when broken and flying glass from a vehicle injured 3 people. Winds were estimated at 70 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE: A swath of damaging winds north of Lake Providence caused numerous trees, power poles, and power lines to have been blown down. Substantial damage occurred to the Shelburn Fire Station and numerous homes were damaged. A tree fell on a house on Highland Road.
772901	2009-06-07	HAIL	CO	0	0	1.61e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Severe thunderstorms in Denver and the surrounding metropolitan area produced five tornadoes, large hail and damaging thunderstorm winds.  The strongest of the tornadoes touched down near Southlands Mall, in southeast Aurora.  Two men were injured, one seriously.   Overall the damage was rated mild to moderate, which translated to an EF1 rating.  Four other tornadoes touched down, two of which caused minor damage.  Another EF1 tornado damaged a home, several outbuildings, and injured some horses in unincorporated Elbert County. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail from 1 to 3 inches in diameter was observed.  In parts of Aurora and Centennial, thunderstorm winds blew down power lines and caused electrical outages.  Approximately 8,000 homes and businesses were left without power for nearly two hours.  Most of the damage consisted of broken windows and roofs.  This day was the first in a series of eight to cause damage along the Urban Corridor.  Damage to homes and property along the Front Range totalled $161 million during the 8-day span, making it the state's fifth highest insurance loss.  The majority of the property damage was caused by hail; 21,000 automobile claims and 13,000 homeowner claims were filed.EVENT NARRATIVE: 
779438	2009-07-20	HAIL	CO	0	0	3.5e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A severe thunderstorm produced damaging winds, large hail and very heavy rain across the western and southern suburbs of Denver.  Widespread damage was observed in the cities of Arvada, Wheat Ridge and Lakewood.  The intense straightline winds were the result of a wet microburst which downed hundreds of trees and snapped power poles.  Winds gusts to 80 mph were reported along with nickel to golfball size hail.  The combination of wind and hail produced widepread damage to homes and vehicles.  The damage claim estimates totaled $350 million; about 32,900 claims were filed for homes, while another 19,500 claims were for vehicles.  As many as 90,000 homes and businesses were left without power.  In some areas it took up to 3 days to completely restore electrical service.  Minor injuries were reported from broken glass during the storm, but no one was hospitalized.   The storm crippled the computers at the Colorado Crime Information Center in Lakewood for nearly 3 hours.  One weak tornado was also observed. In Larimer and Weld Counties, severe thunderstorms produced widepread damage over approximately 150 square miles of farmland.  In all, 400 farms were directly impacted by severe weather.  Damage to crops alone was estimated to be around $4 million; most of the damage was observed in Weld County.EVENT NARRATIVE:

This tornado touched down just south of I-20, west of Tallulah, in Madison Parish. The tornado intensified quickly and became large as it tracked at a fast pace to the northeast. The tornado moved at roughly 55 mph and was on the ground for 149 miles. The actual time on the ground was 2 hours and 44 minutes. The tornado touched 9 counties/parishes along it's path with the most significant damage occurring in Madison Parish, Warren, Yazoo, Holmes, Attala and Choctaw Counties. A great deal of the damage was in the EF2 and EF3 range with a couple locations of EF4 damage in Yazoo and Holmes Counties. Maximum winds peaked around 170 mph. Overall, 10 fatalities occurred along with 146 injuries. Five fatalities occurred in Choctaw County, 4 in Yazoo County, and 1 in Holmes County. As we try and put this tornado into perspective for the state of Mississippi, this long track tornado ranks as the 4th longest in Mississippi history at 149 miles.  It is the widest known tornado with a maximum width of 1.75 miles.  It also ranks as the 9th deadliest tornado with 10 fatalities, making it the most deadly since November 21st 1992.  Lastly, this was the first violent tornado (F4 or greater) in the month of April since April 18th, 1978.EVENT NARRATIVE: The tornado moved out of extreme southeast Sharkey County and into west central Yazoo County and gained intensity as it tracked northeast. The tornado caused significant home damage northwest of Satartia, and again as it crossed Highway 3 near the Crupp Community. The tornado then moved through a rural area southwest of Yazoo City, causing major damage or destruction of a number of homes, as well as intense tree damage.  As the tornado approached the intersection of US Highway 49 and Highway 16, on the south side of Yazoo City, it reached its widest point and maximum intensity. Here the rating peaked at EF4 with maximum winds around 170 mph. The tornado had a maximum width of 1.75 miles. Several buildings, including a church and several businesses, were totally destroyed. The tornado continued moving through residential areas on the southeast side of Yazoo City, heavily damaging or destroying numerous homes.  The tornado continued northeast through rural northeastern Yazoo County before it tracked into Holmes County. A total of four fatalities occurred in Yazoo County. All of the fatalities were individuals who were in mobile homes.
803673	2010-05-01	FLOOD	TN	0	0	5e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: An upper level disturbance slowly approached the Mid-South during the evening of April 30th, 2010 as a cold front became stationary to the west. This pattern remained in place through the evening hours of May 2nd, 2010. South to southwest winds pumped warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and created a very unstable atmosphere. Showers and thunderstorms developed in association with the front during the early evening hours and moved east into Eastern Arkansas shortly before midnight. Additional thunderstorms occurred in association with the upper level disturbance. Due to the unstable atmosphere, thunderstorms quickly became severe producing large hail, damaging winds, and flash flooding. The severe weather evolved into an outbreak by May 1st and 2nd. Historic rainfall and flash flooding in addition to large hail and damaging winds occurred during the early morning hours of May 1st with several tornadoes occurring during the afternoon hours of May 1st to early morning hours of May 2nd.EVENT NARRATIVE: Heavy rainfall in excess of 10-15 inches produced flash flooding which later transitioned to a flood event across Gibson County. The North Fork Forked Deer quickly rose to record levels. Water spilled out of its banks and flooded areas near Trenton and Milan. Numerous homes and businesses were flooded as a result.
808257	2010-05-01	FLOOD	TN	10	0	1.5e+09	1000	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A frontal boundary setup across Western and Middle Tennessee late Friday night (April 30), and remained through the weekend.  A persistent southerly flow fed moisture into the area and precipitable water values rose to almost 2 inches, based on data from KOHX upper air soundings.  As a series of shortwaves moved through, a band of showers and thunderstorms developed and remained nearly stationary for much of the day on Saturday, May 1st and Sunday, May 2nd, resulting in widespread record flooding across much of Middle Tennessee.  Some of these thunderstorms became severe also, resulting in thunderstorm wind damage and seven confirmed tornadoes across Middle Tennessee.EVENT NARRATIVE: At U.S. Highway 431 near the Robertson/Davidson County Line at Sycamore Creek, water was overflowing its banks, resulting in flooding of low lying areas. At least one home and farm was reported to be covered with flood waters. At the time of this report, U.S. Highway 431 was still open, although the water level near the base of the road and bridge was rising fast. No additional information was provided concerning any damage to the road or bridge. Also, flooding was reported along Charlotte Road just west of downtown Nashville by the public. Emergency Manager reported closing of Bluff Road due to water covering the road. Water was reported over Culbertson Road along Mill Creek near Nolensville. This made the road impassible to traffic. On Estes Road, approximately one mile west of Green Hills, a creek was flowing over the road. Depth was estimated at three to six inches. This caused the road to become impassible to traffic. Water was running over Old Harding Pike from the Harpeth River near Morton Mill Road. Also, numerous homes, numerous businesses, numerous non comercial buildings, along with several county, state, and federal roads across the county received damage due to the flood. This damage also included major damage to the Opryland Hotel, Grand Ole Opry House, and Opry Mills shopping mall.

Additional thunderstorms developed in the late evening of July 23rd and lasted in the early morning hours of July 24th producing very heavy rain and widespread flash flooding in many parts of the Chicago Metro Area.  Rainfall rates were as much as two to three inches per hour in some areas.EVENT NARRATIVE: Very heavy rain fell across much of north central Cook County producing widespread flooding and flash flooding during the early morning hours of July 24th.  Hundreds of streets and thousands of basements were flooded.  Numerous homes were surrounded by flood waters with water damage on the first floor.  Several hundred vehicles were submerged or floating in flood waters, many were a total loss.  Areas that suffered some of the most widespread flooding and extensive damage included Westchester, Western Springs, La Grange, Oak Park, Bellwood, Riverside, Berwyn, Brookfield, Hillside and Forest Park.  In Westchester, 40 residents were evacuted by boat when their homes were completed surrounded by flood waters.  In Hillside, 56 residents of a convalescent home were evacuated onto a bus because of flood waters.  The bus then became stranded in flood waters and was pushed out by a front-end loader.  Twelve feet of water (which was overflow from the Chicago River) flooded the basement of a 17-story building in River City in Chicago.  No structural damage was reported but 80 to 90 cars in the basement were a total loss.  Portions of both Interstate 94 and Interstate 290 were closed due to flooding, including Interstate 290 just east of Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park.  The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago estimated that over 60 billion gallons of water fell on Chicago and parts of Cook County, which quickly filled all 190 miles of the Deep Tunnel system.  Once this tunnel filled, floodgates were opened in Wilmette and on the Chicago River, releasing untreated stormwater into Lake Michigan.  Storm total rainfall amounts inclueded 7.89 inches one mile southwest of Oak Park; 6.43 inches at O'Hare Airport; 6.16 inches one mile northeast of Countryside; 5.84 inches about a half mile southwest of La Grange Park; 5.82 inches one mile west of Stickney; 5.58 inches near Streamwood; 5.47 inches two miles northwest of Melrose Park and 5.1
833065	2010-09-06	WILDFIRE	CO	0	0	2.17e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: The Fourmile Canyon Wildfire, northwest of Boulder, broke out Monday morning.  It  originated from an unattended fire pit at a local residence.  The wildfire quickly consumed 5 1/2 square miles or 3,500 acres the first day, and forced the evacuation of over 3,000 residents.  Erratic 45-mph gusts sent the fire in two directions at times. Very dry weather conditions preceded the fire.  The combination of strong winds, low relative humidities and dry fuels allowed the wildfire spread rapidly through the steep, heavily forested terrain.  The flames were reportedly 20 to 50 feet in length.  Towns within the burn area included Salina, Wallstreet and Gold Hill.  The dry conditions coupled with gusty winds ranging from 45 to 64 mph persisted for several more days.   Fire managers used as many as 700 firefighters and support personnel from 35 agencies and seven air tankers to battle the wildfire.  A total of 6,181 square acres or approximately 10 square miles were burned.  The Fourmile Canyon Wildfire was the most destructive fire in Colorado history in terms of the damage to personal property.  It destroyed 171 homes with an estimated cost of 217 million dollars.EVENT NARRATIVE: 
833386	2010-09-15	HAIL	KS	0	0	1.5e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A combination of a low pressure area along the Kansas Oklahoma border, and an outflow boundary across South Central Kansas, led to the development of supercell thunderstorms across South Central Kansas.  The supercells thunderstorms were noted for a swath of very large hail that extended from West Wichita to near Udall Kansas. Numerous reports of grapefruit or larger hail were reported across Wichita, with one such hail stone in West Wichita, Kansas, breaking the state record for diameter of 7.75 inches.   A few weak tornadoes were also produced, with all the tornadoes moving across open country.EVENT NARRATIVE: Two supercell thunderstorms left a destructive swath of very large hail across portions of the county. The swath of hail was approximately 5 miles wide and 15 miles long, stretching from northwest of Goddard, Kansas through the western and southern half of Wichita, Kansas to near Rose Hill, Kansas.  Hail as large as softball and grapefruit size pounded roofs and cars along its path with over 35,000 claims turned into insurance agencies.   The hail made roofs look like a war zone, with holes big enough for people to stick their heads through.  Cars and golf courses were pot marked with large dents.  Some of the hail came through roofs, including the terminal at the Mid Continent Airport in Wichita.  Three commercial airliners were damaged and had to be towed to hangers for repairs.  The National Weather Service in Wichita suffered damage to its vehicles, including one hail dent that was almost 10 inches across.  One such hailstone 2 miles west of the National Weather Service office broke the state record for diameter, measuring 7.75 inches across (see separate entry).

This storm produced widespread golf ball to baseball sized hail along its path.  Thousands of roofs and vehicles were damaged by the hail.  Locations in northwest Phoenix and Glendale were impacted by this storm as well as the storm shortly after noon, compounding the damage.  The football coach at Alhambra High School reported at least one injury when large hail struck the practice field. This palm-size hail is likely the largest hail ever reported in the Phoenix area. Large hail, estimated to be upwards of 2 inches in diameter, punctured 34 skylights at the main warehouse of St. Mary's Food bank in Phoenix. As a result, water ruined approximately 20 percent of the food inventory, the equivalent of 1.4 million meals. Rain soaked the food, which was stored in cardboard boxes. This information was reported by St. Mary's spokesman Jerry Brown. The damages of 200 thousand dollars covered both the roof damage as well as money to replace the ruined food.

851766	2011-04-16	TORNADO	NC	4	67	1.15e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A strong storm system that had a history of producing deadly tornadoes across Oklahoma and the deep south on the 14th and 15th weakened as it crossed the southern Appalachians during the early morning hours of the 16th.  A squall line descended the Blue Ridge by the late morning hours, and rapidly intensified  as it moved east into the central Piedmont of North Carolina, with four long live tornadic supercells evolving from the linear convective segment. These tornadic supercells went on to produce 9 tornadoes in the Raleigh CWA, including 2 EF3s, and 4 EF2s. The tornadoes left 6 dead with approximately 275 injuries.EVENT NARRATIVE: The tornado exited Chatham County and entered southwest Wake County as an EF0. There was multiple tree and roof damage along Avent Ferry Road, southwest of Holly Springs. The tornado intensified to an EF1 with winds of 86 mph as it reached Fire Station Number Two and the Holly Glenn Subdivision before crossing highway 55 and tracking through the Remington subdivision.  The tornado continued to track northeastward and caused extensive tree damage and damage to numerous homes, mainly from fallen trees along Pierce Olive, Ten-Ten, Penny Road, and Yates Mill Pond roads, as wind speeds increased to around 100 mph. The tornado crossed Tryon Road, between Lake Wheeler Road and the Raleigh Golf Association Golf Course, before tracking northeast across the entire City of Raleigh, producing EF1 damage in a narrow swath between 50 to 100 yards. It crossed directly over Interstates 40-440, between exits 297 and 298 with damage on both sides of the interstate clearly visible. The tornado continued northeast across South Saunders Street, where 4 businesses were damaged. A body shop was completely destroyed when the roof was ripped off and the side walls collapsed. The tornado continued to snap hardwood trees and power-lines near Mount Hope Cemetery and nearby homes. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast towards Shaw University. Campus dormitories and the university student center had windows blown in with roof damage. The tornado moved northeast along the east side of the major high rise buildings in downtown Raleigh, downing hundreds of trees, many of which fell on houses. The historic Oakwood to Lion`s Park sections of town, including the historic Oakwood Cemetery were hardest hit. Also in the path of the tornado was Saint Augustine`s College, which sustained roof damage to every building on campus. The tornado continued to down trees on numerous homes as it crossed North King Charles Road to Yonkers Road, producing EF1 damage to several businesses.  Th
859151	2011-04-27	TORNADO	AL	4	45	1e+09	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A powerful storm system roared across the Southeast United States on Wednesday, April 27, 2011. In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone. Some of the devastation was literally unimaginable with countless homes, neighborhoods and even portions of cities or towns either partially or completely destroyed. This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.   The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.   The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities iEVENT NARRATIVE: The violent tornado continued it's path from the Tennessee River along the Lawrence/Limestone county line northeast through Tanner and into the east Central portion of Limestone County.   Homes were completely obliterated along a wide swath in the Tanner community.  Nearly a dozen high tension power lines were snapped or taken to the ground in Limestone County.  Concrete power poles were also snapped off at their base.  A subsequent ground team, aided by a storm survey expert from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, surveyed the most intense damage in Limestone County.  High end EF-3 damage was noted over a large area in eastern Limestone County along and north of the East Limestone High School.  The intensity was maximized in Limestone County in the community of Tanner, with a large swath of EF-4 damage and a narrow corridor of high end EF-4 damage.  Several well-constructed homes with anchor bolting were completely wiped clean.  One home had the debris lofted over 300 hundred yards with large items carried completely away.  Intense ground scarring was noted in this area.  In addition, a large cargo container was picked up and blown approximately 600 yards and several cars were carried airborne for hundreds of yards.  In all, hundreds of homes received moderate to major damage along the path with many of these being total losses.
856844	2011-04-25	TORNADO	AR	0	4	1.25e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: From the 24th through the 27th, the arrival of a slow-moving cold front and several low pressure areas aloft triggered several rounds of thunderstorms. Tornadoes, severe storms, and flash flooding resulted. Widespread areal flooding followed the flash flooding. Some of this flooding was due to heavy rain, while some of it was caused by water from rivers, creeks, and bayous backing up onto the land. On the evening of the 25th, devastating tornadoes affected several areas in central Arkansas. More than 140,000 electric customers in Arkansas lost power. Heavy rains during this period were the beginning of the Great Flood of 2011 in Arkansas. Much of the flooding lasted well into May, and some even continued all the way to late June.EVENT NARRATIVE: Most of this tornado's path was through Little Rock Air Force Base. At least five C-130 aircraft were damaged, three of them severely. A number of buildings in the base shopping area and flight line area suffered damage, including having roofs torn off. The fire station had its roof taken off and its doors buckled. Altogether, more than 20 tons of sheet metal from roofs and buildings was recovered for recycling. Cars were overturned in the parking lot of the Base Exchange. More than 135 houses in the base housing area were damaged or destroyed. A toilet from a house in the base housing area was found lodged in the roof of the Base Exchange shopping center, more than 1/2 mile away. Four people were injured at the air base. North Pulaski High School also suffered damage. The auditorium had its roof torn off and one wall collapsed. A wall of the chemistry building collapsed, weakening the roof of a building that housed 15 classrooms.

857331	2011-04-04	TORNADO	MS	0	0	5e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A powerful storm system took shape across the central United States and clashed with a warm and unstable airmass. An extensive and intense squall line resulted which quickly pushed eastward across the eastern half of the country. Overall, this system produced a large severe weather outbreak and brought widespread wind damage to multiple states across the south, mid south, and southeast United States. Nearly 1500 reports of severe weather were reported, across 15 states, with the vast majority being damaging winds. Wind damage was not the only severe weather event type, large hail and tornadoes were also part of the mix. In terms of total events (severe weather reports), this outbreak is one of the largest in the United States. Across the National Weather Service Jackson forecast area, numerous reports of down trees and power lines were reported along with multiple reports of damaged structures. These structures were damaged by either fallen trees or intense winds. Survey teams found 5 tornadoes across the area, two of which were rated EF2. The first strong tornado moved into northwest Catahoula Parish from LaSalle Parish. The other strong tornado occurred across Tensas Parish and tracked to the MS River, crossed the river and dissipated in far northwest Claiborne County. The other three tornadoes were rated EF1. One of these occurred just north of Utica, in Hinds County, another tracked across northern Simpson County near Braxton, and the other across southeast Lincoln and southern Lawrence Counties.EVENT NARRATIVE: The tornado started by downing trees along Cole Drive west of the Ruth community.  The tornado quickly intensified and produced its first area of damage with winds estimated near 100 mph in Ruth.  The awning of a gas station was destroyed, the volunteer fire department building had the back wall blown out, a church had the steeple blown off along with extensive shingle damage, and a number of homes suffered roof damage due to trees falling on them or due to direct minor roof damage.  The tornado continued to move east across southeast Lincoln county and into southwest Lawrence county to the northwest and north of Jayess, causing tree damage.  A few trees here fell on homes, and one fell on an RV vehicle, completely destroying it.  After appearing to weaken northeast of Jayess, the tornado restrengthened after moving east of Mississippi Highway 27.  The tornado again caused damaging indicative of winds of 100 mph along Tom Sistrunk Road.  Numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted, and several homes had minor to moderate roof damage.  The tornado then weakened as it moved east, dissipating just before reaching the border between Lawrence and Marion counties. Maximum winds were around 100 mph. Total path length across Lincoln and Lawrence Counties was 17 miles. While the damage pattern associated with this tornado had clear tornadic indications with a convergent damage pattern, there was also damage indicative of straight line winds to the west and north of the tornado, primarily from west to north of Ruth.  A number of trees were downed in this area, some on power lines.

862563	2011-05-22	TORNADO	MO	158	1150	2.8e+09	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: A strong upper level trough across the central plains region and a strong upper level disturbance along with a frontal boundary in the area produced numerous severe storms with a few supercells across southeast Kansas. One cyclic supercell associated with the system produced a very large and deadly EF-5 tornado that hit the city of Joplin and then spawned two separate tornadoes that moved across southwestern Missouri. A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma.  Continuing thunderstorms lasted into July 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts. One of the two officers later died of injuries from the lightning strike.EVENT NARRATIVE: National Weather Service survey teams rated the tornado that tracked across the southwest through east central portion of Joplin, Missouri, as an EF5 tornado.  Maximum winds were estimated to have exceeded 200 miles per hour. The tornado had a maximum width of one mile and an overall path length of nearly 21.6 miles, nearly nine miles of which occurred in Jasper County. The tornado killed 158 directly, three indirectly, and injured over 1150 people.  Sadly, on May 24 a police officer who was volunteering from another department, was struck by lightning while serving in the response efforts and later died.  Equally, a 56 year old man who had been included as a direct fatality was later determined to have died of a heart attack.  Over 10,200 people filed for disaster assistance following the tornado. The EF-5 rating (greater than 200 mph wind speeds) was mainly arrived at by the total destruction of vehicles, including some vehicles tossed several blocks and semi trucks thrown a quarter of a mile. Parking stops weighing over 300 pounds and re-barred into asphalt were uprooted and tossed.  Other factors in the rating included damage to reinforced concrete structures, and that St. Johnb
865013	2011-05-22	TORNADO	MN	1	48	1.66e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: During the early afternoon of Sunday May 22nd, a line of thunderstorms developed across south central Minnesota, and quickly moved north and northeast across east-central Minnesota, and into west-central Wisconsin. One spawned a tornado in North Minneapolis, and crossed into southern Anoka County. Another tornado occurred near Ham Lake, and another near Forest Lake that afternoon.EVENT NARRATIVE: A strong EF-1 tornado touched down approximately 3/4 of a mile south-southwest of the intersection of Interstate 394 and Highway 100 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It traveled north-northeast through Golden Valley, and across North Minneapolis, before moving into Anoka County.  Damage was widespread along the path and caused damage to businesses near the intersection of Interstate 394, and Highway 100.  As it crossed Highway 100, it began to damage numerous residences along Cedar Lake Road before moving into Theodore Wirth Park.  The tornado moved across Wirth Park, and into the City of North Minneapolis, between Glenwood Avenue and 16th Avenue.  Most of the damage at this point was EF-0 and was confined to downed trees and roof damage.  It strengthened to EF-1 as it moved into North Minneapolis.  The tornado tracked across Penn Avenue and Broadway, then to Lowry Avenue and Logan Avenue, then to 42nd Avenue to Lyndale Avenue before crossing the Mississippi River.  Damage along this path was extensive to garages, with sheds and roofs removed. A male was killed as a tree fell on his car while he was driving in North Minneapolis. City officials stated that more than 600 buildings would require major repairs, and 35 homes were so badly damaged they could not be reoccupied.

At Cape Girardeau, 31.85 inches of rain fell between March and May. This set the record for the wettest meteorological spring (March through May) and was 68 percent of the normal rainfall for the entire year. The result of all this rain was rapid and dramatic rises on rivers. Record flood crests occurred on some rivers, inundating numerous homes and businesses. There were major impacts to transportation both on land and water. There were numerous closed roads across the region, leading to often lengthy detours. Because of the high water, there were numerous day and nighttime restrictions to barge traffic. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland were flooded. Crops were late getting planted.EVENT NARRATIVE: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers activated the New Madrid Floodway by detonating a levee at Birds Point. The intentional levee breach relieved pressure on levees along the lower Ohio River and portions of the Mississippi River. The blast that opened the 11,000-foot gap in the levee shattered windows in Mississippi County and rattled windows as far away as Paducah, Kentucky. The flash flood caused by the levee breach was anticipated for days, and evacuations had been completed beforehand. Over 130,000 acres of prime farmland were submerged. About 100 homes were flooded, forcing the evacuation of 300 residents. The tiny community of Pinhook was inundated, and no decision had been made by residents on whether to rebuild the community. A primary national insurer estimated private property losses were around 100 million dollars within the floodway. Mississippi County officials estimated the cost to repair public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and ditches was nearly 75 million dollars. The westward extent of the flash flood was limited by a second set of levees (called setback levees) designed to channel the water back toward the Mississippi River. The floodway remained submerged for the remainder of the month.
876356	2011-06-17	FLASH FLOOD	IL	0	0	1.5e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Thunderstorms initiated along an old outflow boundary extending from Jacksonville to near Lawrenceville during the evening of June 17th.  Due to a strong low-level jet flowing into the area, the storms continually re-developed and tracked across the same locations, producing between 5 and 10 inches of rain across parts of Morgan and western Sangamon counties through the morning of June 18th.  As a result, widespread flash flooding occurred from the Jacksonville area eastward to the Sangamon County border.  Significant flash flooding also occurred in a large part of southeast Illinois where 3 to 9 inches of rain was reported. A few of the storms also produced gusty winds and small hail.EVENT NARRATIVE: Flash flooding of historic proportions occurred in much of Morgan County from late in the evening of June 17th through much of June 18th. Rainfall amounts of 5.00 to 10.00 were reported, with the highest totals in east central Morgan County from Alexander to Franklin.  The nearly stationary thunderstorms produced a majority of the rain between 2200 LST and 0300 LST. The cities of Jacksonville and South Jacksonville recorded nearly 6.00 of rain in less than six hours, which was about 1.00 higher than a 100 year flood for that time period.  Nearly 2,500 homes, more than 100 businesses - including the Nestle Chocolate plant and many restaurants, MacMurrary College, and a state prison with more than 1,600 inmates sustained major flash flood damage. A levee for Mauvaise Terre Lake was overtopped at the Jacksonville Water Treatment Plant, destroying much of the equipment at the facility and shutting off the drinking water supply in Jacksonville for about three weeks until the equipment could be replaced and tested.  Several miles of Interstate 72 east and south of Jacksonville were closed due to high water during the morning of June 18th. Most streets in eastern and southern parts of Jacksonville were covered with several feet of water, and every rural road and highway in the eastern half of the county was water covered and closed.  Numerous people had to be rescued from their vehicles and at the Rolling Acres Mobile Estates mobile home park, however there were no reports of injuries or fatalities. Several pets, however, drowned due to the flooding at the mobile home park.  Property and business damages were estimated to be about $150 Million. There was no estimate available for crop damages in eastern Morgan County. The flash flooding continued as an areal flood for the same areas for at least another 40 hours, but the impacts of the flooding were felt for more than three weeks.
880538	2011-06-01	TORNADO	MA	3	200	227600000	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: An upper level closed low over southern Ontario tracked across Quebec while at the surface, a cold front over western New York crossed southern New England in the evening of June 1.  An environment characterized by high CAPE (2000-3000 J/kg) and high shear (greater than 200 m2/s2) was in place across western Massachusetts.  In addition, mid level lapse rates were an impressive 7 to 8 C/km.  Thunderstorms forming ahead of the front organized into discrete supercells in an environment highly favorable for tornado formation.   While convection fired early in the day along a weak low level theta-e ridge across north central Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, clearing allowed for rapid destabilization in the afternoon.   Thunderstorms developed during the morning ahead of the cold front from eastern Pennsylvania into southeast New York and Vermont.  By about 3 pm, the storms entered western Massachusetts and were in the form of discrete supercells.  By 4 pm, several supercells had developed across southern Vermont, southwest New Hampshire, and western Massachusetts.  At that time, the supercell which eventually produced the most significant tornado entered Hampden County from the Berkshires.   This cell produced what was evaluated to be an EF-3 tornado touching down in Westfield and continuing on a 39 mile long trek through West Springfield, Springfield, Wilbraham, Monson, Brimfield, and Sturbridge.  This tornado was on the ground for an estimated 70 minutes. About two hours later, another supercell tracked just to the north of the storm track of the EF3 tornado. While its rotation was not as strong, it produced brief tornadoes in Wilbraham (EF1), North Brimfield (EF1), and Sturbridge (EF0). While the focus was certainly on the tornadoes and their damage, damaging winds, large hail up to two inches in diameter, and some flash flooding also occurred across southern New England.EVENT NARRATIVE: A supercell thunderstorm developed over western Massachusetts.  This storm strengthened and produced a long-lived, very significant tornado that did extensive damage across southwest and south central Massachusetts. This storm will be noted not only for its intensity, but also for the length of the continuous damage path, approximately 37 miles, 31 of which were in Hampden County.  The tornado was also very wide at some points, reaching a maximum width of one half mile. The tornado first touched down in the Munger Hill section of Westfield with damage mainly limited to trees, many uprooted and snapped.  The roof of Munger Hill Elementary School was also damaged.  The tornado rapidly intensified as it moved into West Springfield and caused extensive damage to industrial buildings and homes.  Several buildings had their roofs removed by the tornado, a few structures collapsed, and several multi-story buildings lost their upper stories.   The tornado then crossed the Connecticut River adjacent to the Memorial Avenue bridge and into the city of Springfield.  Here the tornado produced extensive damage to the south side of the downtown area with many homes destroyed.  In addition, commercial brick buildings sustained major damage.  Roofs were removed from many of these large commercial structures.  The tornado also produced severe structural damage to townhomes and apartments near Springfield College.  The tornado continued moving east into the Island Pond section of Springfield, where Cathedral High School and St. Michael's Academy sustained significant damage and many homes in this part of the city were completely destroyed. The tornado continued to move east through Wilbraham near the Wilbraham/Hampden town line producing nearly complete deforestation and significant damage to nearby structures. Widespread damage occurred in Monson as the tornado moved directly through the center of town.  Many houses were completely destroyed and significant d

At Denver International Airport alone, large hail up to golfball size, very heavy rain and wind gusts to 59 mph caused substantial damage to 40 planes and stranded approximately 1,500 passengers overnight.  Frontier and United Airlines were hardest hit as dozens of planes were taken out of service for repairs; forcing the cancellation of at least 220 flights over the next several days.  Damage to the aircrafts alone was nearly $5 million.   In addition, 83 cars in airport parking lots were damaged, along with some police cars and maintenance vehicles.  In Watkins, two people suffered minor injuries and 35 to 40 homes were damaged.  As many as 200 residents in a mobile home park were left homeless by the storm, forcing the Red Cross to open a shelter at Bennett High School.  The trailer park contained 52 mobile homes, 14 recreational vehicles, 3 houses and a commercial building.  Hailstones the size of softballs cratered the north sides of the mobile homes.  Some farmers in the area said they lost as much as 85 percent of their total wheat crop.  Power lines were also damaged which affected about 1,200 customers in Watkins.  The strong winds also flipped over a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 70 near Watkins Road.  Insurance claims for the Watkins, Bennett and Brighton areas was estimated to be $17 million.  The total damage estimate across the entire Urban Corridor, was $164.8 million, and included 17,200 automobile claims and 12,600 homeowner claims. In addition, thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall, caused flash flooding in the Four Mile Canyon burn scar west of Boulder.  Three homes reportedly had water up to the windows with water flowing into structures at Fourmile Canyon Road and Gold Run Road.  The heavy rain caused a 4-ft surge along Fourmile Creek through Orodell and into the entry of Boulder Creek.  Several roads were affected which restriEVENT NARRATIVE: 
893301	2011-08-28	FLOOD	VT	0	0	5e+08	250000	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Tropical Storm Irene moved across southeast New York and southwest New England during the morning hours of August 28th and then proceeded to track north along the Connecticut River Valley in Vermont during the afternoon and evening. Strong to damaging winds in excess of 60 mph was observed within several miles of Lake Champlain in northwest Vermont as well as exposed higher terrain in southern Vermont and wind gusts approaching 50 mph downed trees elsewhere in Vermont during the afternoon hours. A peak wind gust of 85 mph was measured at the summit of Mount Mansfield (4400 ft - Lamoille county). Approximately 100,000 customers were without power during the storm. The main, devastating impact from Irene was widespread, devastating flooding, especially for central and southern Vermont. Widespread rainfall amounts of 3-5 inches occurred across Vermont with 5 to 7+ inches across much of southern, central Vermont and elevations above 1000 feet along the spine of Vermont's Green Mountains and the Worcester range.  Devastating flash flooding occurred across much of central and southern Vermont mountain valleys with substantial and some record breaking flood stages on larger rivers.  This flood event will likely rank second to the November 1927 flood in the scope of meteorological and hydrological conditions/impacts as well as loss of life (84 in 1927), but likely first in monetary damage ((approx $500. million statewide vs $350. million (1927 in 2010 dollars)). There were nearly 2400 roads, 800 homes/businesses, 300 bridges and a half dozen railroad tracks destroyed or damaged from the flooding caused by Irene.EVENT NARRATIVE: Heavy rain from Tropical Storm Irene inundated roads in Orleans County Vermont. The Barton River flooded river road near Orleans, and the Barton River at Coventry crested at 10.27 feet at 04:00 am EST Aug 29, over two feet above flood stage of 8.0 feet. Other local roads near Troy were flooded by the Missisquoi river, and the Missisquoi at North Troy crested at 13.94 feet at 02:30 am EST Aug 29, almost five feet over flood stage of 9.0 feet.

893654	2011-08-28	FLOOD	NJ	1	0	2e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Irene produced torrential downpour rains that resulted in major flooding and a number of record breaking crests on area rivers, tropical storm force wind gusts with record breaking outages for New Jersey utilities, one confirmed tornado and a three to five foot storm surge that caused moderate to severe tidal flooding with extensive beach erosion over the weekend of August 27th and 28th. Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds EVENT NARRATIVE: Morris County was greatly effected by flooding from Irene, especially along the Passaic and Pompton Rivers.  In Dover Township, a construction worker fell off a bridge, was washed away and drowned in the Rockaway River. About 4,000 homes in the county were affected by flood waters in Pequannock, Lincoln Park, Dover, Parsippany and Denville. The flooding along the Rockaway River forced the collapse of the northbound Interstate 287 roadway shoulder in Boonton. All northbound lanes remained closed until August 30th. In Hanover Township, a 177-yearold historic First Presbyterian Church of Whippany suffered approximately about $350,000 in damages, one of the hardest hit structures in the county. Full scale evacuations occurred in Pequannock Township and Lincoln Park Borough. In Pequannock, over 800 homes were damaged by flood waters, many had four to six feet of water on their first floor. In Denville, 500 homes were flooded and damaged. Other homes were damaged in Dover and Pine Brook. In Parsippany, the National Guard was needed to rescue people from two flooded hotels. Other major roadways that were closed due to flooding included New Jersey State Routes 10, 23, 46 and 53.

897147	2011-09-07	FLOOD	PA	4	0	1.5e+08	7e+05	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Heavy rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee produced widespread flooding, flash flooding and river flooding mainly near and to the east of the Susquehanna Valley from September 4-10. Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania.  Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall. The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River.

The Susquehanna River at Harrisburg crested in major flood stage at 25.17 feet.  Flood stage is 17 feet.  This is the 5th highest crest on record. While the Susquehanna River flooded a large area of Harrisburg, some areas were fortunate enough to escape the flood waters.  Midtown and Uptown residents were largely unscathed, though widespread power outages were reported.  The river levels crested several feet below that of Agnes, thanks in part to less contribution from the West Branch of the Susquehanna. Between 8,000 and 10,000 residents were evacuated.  The Shipoke area of downtown reported significant flooding. City Island was also hard hit, with the baseball stadium under at least seven feet of water, prompting the double A baseball team to have to play its playoff games on the road. Major damage was widespread in Hershey.  Hersheypark and ZooAmerica both reported major damage with 8 feet of water in low lying areas of Hershey Park.  Many structures were flooded and many roads suffered damage.  A ramp off of Route 322 near the Penn State Hershey Medical Center had a 3-foot deep trench cut across the road.  Swatara Creek cut a wide and devastating flood path.  Evacuations were noted in Palmyra, Derry Township and Middletown. A 70-year old man died when a basement wall collapsed on him in Derry Township. He was pumping water from his flooded basement. A second man died in flood waters. While details surrounding his death are unknown, his mud covered car and body were found in Swatara Township several days after the flooding. A third man, 81 years old, drowned after his car was washed into Clarks Creek in Middle Paxton Township. Finally, a fourth victim, a 54 year old female, was swept away by flood waters
898319	2011-09-07	FLOOD	NY	0	0	3.09e+08	0	EPISODE NARRATIVE: The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee moved northward from the southern Appalachians on the 6th to the middle Atlantic states on the 7th before stalling on the 8th. The moisture from Lee interacted with a frontal system to the west across the eastern Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes. In addition, moisture was drawn into New York and Pennsylvania from Hurricane Katia which was moving northward off the east coast in tandem with the remnants of Lee. This complicated scenario led to an extreme amount of rain for central New York and northeast Pennsylvania, most of which fell over a 48 hour period from the 6th to the 8th. Rainfall of 6 to 12 inches occurred over most of the upper Susquehanna river basin in New York and northeast Pennsylvania. The heavy rain caused massive, record breaking flooding on small streams, creeks and the Susquehanna River and its larger tributaries.  The main branch of the Susquehanna River in New York from Binghamton to Vestal, Owego and Waverly crested from 1 to 4 feet higher than the previous record crests set in June 2006.  In Pennsylvania, record crests occurred along the Susquehanna River at Meshoppen and Wilkes Barre which exceeded the long-standing record crests by around 1 foot associated with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Damages in the upper Susquehanna River Basin in New York and Pennsylvania are close to 1 billion dollars. Unfortunately, the flooding claimed 1 life and injured 1 person in central New York and northeast Pennsylvania.EVENT NARRATIVE: A record flood occurred on the Susquehanna river at Owego, NY. The crest was recorded by a high water mark survey at 39.62 feet on September 8, 2011 with an estimated time at about 3:00 PM. This flood smashed the previous record flood event by being nearly 4 feet higher.

The crest was 25.71 feet at 3:00 PM on September 8, 2011. The flood waters topped the flood protection walls and levees, causing extensive flooding throughout the downtown areas of Binghamton. This surpassed the previous record of 25.0 feet set during the June 2006 flood.
898415	2011-09-07	FLOOD	PA	4	0	1.5e+08	7e+05	EPISODE NARRATIVE: Heavy rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee produced widespread flooding, flash flooding and river flooding mainly near and to the east of the Susquehanna Valley from September 4-10. Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania.  Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall. The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDTEVENT NARRATIVE: Swatara Creek near Hershey crested at major flood stage, 26.8 feet.  Flood stage is 7.0 feet. Swatara Creek at Middletwon crested at major flood stage, estimated at 26.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 5th highest all time. The Susquehanna River at Harrisburg crested in major flood stage at 25.17 feet.  Flood stage is 17 feet.  This is the 5th highest crest on record.
